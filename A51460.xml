            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Should be thought perhaps, no leſs unmannerly than fanciful, if I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered any other reaſon of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors publiſhing this Book, than what he himſelf is pleaſed to give in his Epiſtle Dedicatory to his Great Maſter, the <hi>Moſt Chriſtian King;</hi> which is, that he might thereby according to his duty, ſecond the grand deſign of the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Church, in removing thoſe obſtacles that hinder the reconciliation of Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Believers, and in confuting the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes of <hi>Authors,</hi> who have occaſioned either a ſcandalous ſeparation from the Unity of the Church, or a perſiſtance in that Separation. Yet ſeeing the Book be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it came out, and ſince it hath been Publiſhed, hath made no ſmall noiſe at <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Court, and elſewhere;
<pb facs="tcp:97808:3"/>The Reader poſſibly, may think that ſo Publick and Religious a deſign hath been either very ill Managed, or far worſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted. I have nothing to ſay as to that, it being a matter above my reach; but I know the Ingenious will be apt to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, ſuch as are now a days very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent; that no great matter ought, or, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed can be brought about, if <hi>Religion</hi> came not in for a ſhare, and if that turn not the World, it will be hard for any thing elſe to convert it. There is Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo called, that makes <hi>Turks</hi> fight againſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> not fight againſt <hi>Turks;</hi> that makes ſome <hi>States</hi> invade the Rights of the <hi>Church,</hi> and ſome <hi>Churches</hi> uſurp upon the <hi>State;</hi> that makes the <hi>Godly</hi> Plot and fight for Peace ſake, and the <hi>harmleſs Doves</hi> as innocent as <hi>Serpents.</hi> And ſince theſe and many other ſuch Principles are now a days in great vogue over moſt part of the World; one may venture to ſay of the
<pb facs="tcp:97808:3"/>Religion which many, nay I would it were not, moſt Men practiſe at preſent, what the <hi>Great Author</hi> of our true Religion ſays of the Wind; <hi>It bloweth where it liſteth, and Men hear the ſound of it; but neither know whence it cometh, nor whither it goeth.</hi> And I ſhould not be irreverent beyond example, if I called it downright <hi>Hocus Pocus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This may ſeem to the Reader an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance, and a ſtart out of the road; but I had nothing elſe to ſay for my ſelf in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to Tranſlate a Book that, like a Quarter-Staff, ſtrikes on both Hands, pelts Proteſtants and knocks down the Pope; ſave only that nothing of Modern Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on moved me to it (for, indeed, I find not that I have any inward call to labour in anothers Vineyard) but perceiving that this is an Age wherein People either open their own Eyes, or deſire they ſhould be opened, I was very willing, ſince I am no loſer, nor I hope the Government of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
<pb facs="tcp:97808:4"/>by it, to reach to others the <hi>Eye-ſalve</hi> that hath been handed to me. And, truly, if by impartial Readers, the iſſue of a Mans Religion ſhould be tried by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of the Authors Book, perhaps it would be no eaſie matter to decide the Point; ſince they'll find in it, too much either for a <hi>True Proteſtant,</hi> or a truly <hi>Jeſuited Papiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How far this may juſtifie my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking I cannot tell; but ſince the Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller can ſatisfie the <hi>Reader,</hi> with how great diſpatch it hath been Tranſlated, I hope, he will be ſo kind as to pardon the haſty miſtakes of the Tranſlator.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>ONE of the greateſt impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that hinders the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union of Proteſtants with the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, from which by a fatal Schiſm they are ſeparated, is that falſe Opinion wherewith they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced, that we raiſe the Popes even above the Univerſal Church, in attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting to them what only belongs to her, and in giving them an abſolute and unlimited Power not only in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituals, but alſo over the Temporal and Crowns of Princes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, willing to help on that great zeal which <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> makes ſo conſpicuouſly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful
<pb facs="tcp:97808:5"/>for the Converſion of your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects who continue ſtill in Error, hath thought that ſhe could not do any thing to better purpoſe, than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move that obſtacle, by undeceiving them, and profeſſing, as ſhe hath done by a ſolemn Declaration upon a Point of that importance, her Doctrin which is in all things conform to that of the Ancient Church.</p>
            <p>It is the buſineſs of this Treatiſe, which is purely Hiſtorical, to make this out by matters of fact, againſt which no ſubtlety, argumentation, nor Artifice of Novelty can hold good. Nay, Sir, I dare even preſent it to <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> as a Work that, perhaps, may be ſo happy as to contribute ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in making the Juſtice of your Edict known to the World, whereby, in quality of Protector of the Canons, you make the Ancient belief current
<pb facs="tcp:97808:5"/>in the moſt Chriſtian Kingdom.</p>
            <p>This it is, Sir, that makes it truly to be ſaid, that <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> hath done more for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> than the Kings your Predeceſſors, who have enriched her with the great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues ſhe poſſeſſes, and who have raiſed her to the pinacle of Temporal Grandeur and Dignities. For, indeed, all that Wealth and theſe Worldly Grandeurs belong not to her true Kingdom, which being that of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ought not to be of this World. But in commanding by your Laws, that this Doctrin of Antiquity be maintained in <hi>France,</hi> to which the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, which hath always vigourouſly defended the intereſts and juſt Prerogatives of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> hath in all Ages inviolably adhered: You moſt ſolidly eſtabliſh the Primacy of the Pope againſt the
<pb facs="tcp:97808:6"/>Novel attempts of Hereticks who diſpute it, and do all that they can to ſnatch it from him. At the ſame time you take from them the pretext of their Revolt, by letting them ſee, that we believe not that which ſcandaliſes them, and which ſome late Divines at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to him, of their own Head, againſt the manifeſt Judgment of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity.</p>
            <p>That, <hi>Sir,</hi> is what may be called an effectual endeavour for reſtoring the true Kingdom of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to its Juſt Rights, from which Hereticks, who have ſeparated from it through erroneous Notions that have been given them of our Doctrin, have in little more than an Age rent away a great part of <hi>Europe. Your Majeſty</hi> who hath wrought and ſtill work ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Miracles, to render your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom more Powerful and more
<pb facs="tcp:97808:6"/>flouriſhing than ever, and to grant us once more a general Peace, by making our Enemies accept it, upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions you thought fit to preſcribe to them, is apparently appointed of God to work the greateſt of all, in paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the troubles of Religion, and in rendering to the Kingdom of the Church in <hi>France,</hi> its ancient extent, by the reduction of the remnant of our Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>For my own part, who have but very little longer to live, and, who, according to my Profeſſion, can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute nothing to your Conqueſts, but by my ardent Prayers: I ſhall reckon my ſelf moſt happy, and ſhall die content, if I can but joyn a little by my Pen, to thoſe which you daily Atchieve for enlarging the Empire of the Church, by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Hereticks, which by moſt
<pb facs="tcp:97808:7"/>ſoft and efficacious ways you procure; And if by my Writings and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly by this, I can make it known to all the World, as I hope I may, that I am as true a Catholick as a good <hi>French</hi> Man, and that I will die, as I have lived,</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> The Deſign and Draught of this Work, and the Principle on which it moves.</head>
               <p>TO maintain a State in peace and tranquillity, which makes Subjects happy, according to the ſcope that true <hi>Policie</hi> propoſes
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97808:18"/>to it ſelf; The firſt thing that is to be done, is to beat off the enemy that hath taken up Arms for the ruine of it, and then to take care, that the quarrels and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome conteſts, which ſometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe amongſt the chief members of the State, proceed not ſo far, as to occaſion a Civil War.</p>
               <p>All Chriſtians agree, that the true <hi>Church of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is that <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Kingdom,</hi> which he came to eſtabliſh in this world; and which nevertheleſs, as he himſelf hath ſaid, <hi>is not of this world;</hi> becauſe the whole end of it is to procure us eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happineſs, a thing, no ways to be attained to upon Earth. <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> and <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> have often ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen againſt the <hi>Lord</hi> and his <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that they might overturn that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull kingdom, and eſtabliſh their particular Churches upon its ruines; every one pretending, that <hi>his</hi> is the Church of the Lord; though, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, they be no more, all of them, but the Synagogue of <hi>Satan;</hi> and the Kingdom of him, who, in the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97808:18"/>Goſpel, is called the <hi>Prince of this world.</hi> Beſides, it falls out many times, that amongſt Catholicks, who alone are members of the true Church, diſputes and controverſies ariſe, which may trouble the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity and peace that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath left unto them, for ſecuring their happineſs in his Kingdom. It is neceſſary then, for the ſervice of the Church, and for maintaining it always in the flouriſhing ſtate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath eſtabliſhed it, to fight and beat off the enemies that attack it, and to compoſe and calme the quarrels that ariſe amongſt the children of the <hi>Church,</hi> about points that are diſputed with heat, on all hands, and which might, in the end, diſturb the repoſe and peace of the Kingdom of the Son of God.</p>
               <p>As I have wholly devoted my ſelf to the ſervice of the <hi>Church,</hi> ſo have I endeavoured, as much as lay in my power, to acquit my ſelf of the former of thoſe two duties, in my <hi>Treatiſes</hi> of <hi>Controverſie;</hi> and eſpecially in that of <hi>The true Church.</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:97808:19"/>I think I have been pretty ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in that engagement, and repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all the efforts of our Proteſtants, in making it appear, by evident and unanſwerable Arguments, That there is no true Church but ours; which is enough, without more diſpute, to put an end to all our Controverſies, ſince they acknowledge, with us, that the true Doctrine is always that of the true Church of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> I diſcharge my ſelf alſo, as well as I can, of that obligation, in one part of that <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> where I maintain againſt Hereticks, the declared ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the <hi>Holy See,</hi> the primacy, rights, power and authority of the viſible <hi>head</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent then, that I may fulfill my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in its full extent, I muſt labour to prevent the ſpringing up of any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous diviſion amongſt Catholicks, by reaſon of ſome private opinions that divide them, as to that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſubject of the <hi>Church,</hi> into which they are all equally incorporated.</p>
               <p>Now that I may ſolidly carry on ſo laudable and neceſſary an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97808:19"/>It is at firſt to be preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that according to Catholick doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, the Univerſal Church, which ought allways to be viſible, and to continue without Interruption, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the conſummation of all things, is the Society of Chriſtians diſperſed all over the World, united together by the profeſſion of the <hi>True Faith,</hi> the participation of the <hi>True Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> by the bond of the ſame <hi>Law,</hi> and under one and the ſame <hi>Head;</hi> Becauſe the Church,<note place="margin">

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 48. p. 151. l. de un. Eccl. c. 4.</note> though one may have all the reſt, yet if he be ſeparated from the <hi>Head,</hi> and, by conſequent from the body which is united to him, he is, out of the <hi>Church Catholick</hi> by Schiſm; as Hereticks are cut off from it, becauſe of the want of <hi>True Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:97808:20"/>
               <p>And as all the members of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy have not the ſame functions; but the parts that conſtitute it being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate one to another in a lovely order, there are ſome which are for giving motion to the reſt, by the ſpirits that they ſend over all; and ſome for diſtributing the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the reſt receive for growth, and for perſeverance in the perfection of their ſtate: So amongſt the multitudes of believers that make up the Church, and who cannot all be immediately governed, inſtructed and edified by one ſingle man: for edification of the body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> there muſt be, as the great <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks, a great diverſity of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and many Paſtours ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate one to another in an holy <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy,</hi>

                     <hi>Act.</hi> 20. v. 28.</note> to the end the people may have the Sacraments adminiſtred unto them, be inſtructed and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned.</p>
               <p>And that's the reaſon that there are in the world ſo vaſt a number of particular Churches, which have their ſeveral Biſhops, and which are
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97808:20"/>all ſubordinate to a <hi>Principal Church,</hi> of which the Biſhop is the head of all the reſt. And theſe being aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in name of their Churches, in an Oecumenical Council, repreſent the Univerſal Church, which we believe to be infallible, for abſolutely deciding the points of Faith, when her Biſhops, who are the Paſtours and Teachers of Chriſtians, being one and the ſame as well as ſhe, ſay, in her name, to all her members in perfect unity, <hi>Viſum eſt Spiritui Sancto, &amp; vobis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For as the Univerſal Church is a <hi>whole</hi> conſiſting of all believers, and of all particular Churches, which are one, by the Communion which they have with one <hi>Principal Church,</hi> that is the ſource, principle, root and centre of their Unity, as Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaks: So, according to the doctrine of the ſame holy Father,<note place="margin">Epiſcopatus unus eſt, multorum Epiſcoporum concordi numeroſitate diffuſus. <hi>Cypr.</hi> l. de unit.

                  </note> there is but one Epiſcopacy in the Church, whereof each Biſhop fully poſſeſſes a part; and by conſequent there is but one <hi>Chair,</hi> wherein all Biſhops ſit, by virtue of the Union

In the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſaith he, as there is but one Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence by the Unity of Eſſence and Nature, which ſo unites the three Perſons, that they are but one God: So amongſt the many Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Churches throughout all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom, there is but one onely Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, that is to ſay, but one Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy through the unity, not onely of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Belief,</hi> but alſo of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of all the Biſhops with a Head, whence reſults that unity which is inſeparable from the Church of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being preſuppoſed, in which all Catholicks do agree,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> on <hi>Pſ.</hi> 101.</note> it is certain that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf hath eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed his Church, which he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by his own bloud, and unto which he hath given the <hi>Faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 20. v. 28.</note> the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> in his Goſpel, and a viſible <hi>Head</hi> to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97808:21"/>him as his <hi>Vicar</hi> upon Earth. And as from a very ſmall beginning it hath enlarged it ſelf (according to the Prophecies) over the whole earth: So alſo the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and their Succeſſours, after the departure of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> have founded particular Churches, eſtabliſhing them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or ordaining Biſhops for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning the believers diſtributed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſeveral Dioceſes in all the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the World.</p>
               <p>Now ſeeing that particular Church, which within a few years after the Aſcenſion of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> was ſetled in the Capital City of the Empire, is without doubt, the moſt illuſtrious of all others; that on the one hand, Hereticks not being able to endure its ſplendour and greatneſs, have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways furiouſly riſen up and conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to deſtroy it; and that on the other, all Catholicks, who are ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the real advantages that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh it from all others, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs divided about certain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives which ſome attribute to it, and others diſpute: I ſhall ſhew,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97808:22"/>without ſpeaking of other Churches, what hath been the firſt eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that of <hi>Rome,</hi> what is the excelling dignity thereof, and what are the prerogatives, rights and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of its Biſhops.</p>
               <p>And becauſe a ſubject of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not to be handled by Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical reaſonings, but by matters of fact drawn from Scripture, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted according to the Fathers, Councils, and ancient Traditions, which are the two principles of true Theology: therefore you are not to expect any ſpeculation or Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy in this Treatiſe, which is purely Hiſtorical. I do in the very entry declare, that there is nothing of mine in this work. For I doe no more, but as a ſincere and exact Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, barely alledge, by uncontrover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted matters of fact, drawn from the one or other of thoſe two ſources, what venerable Antiquity belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved concerning that important mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>This method we uſefully employ againſt our Proteſtants. We make
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97808:22"/>it clearly out to them, that what we believe of the Euchariſt, the Sacrifice of the Maſs, the Invocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints, prayer for the dead, and other controverted points, is the ancient Doctrine of the Church; and that ſo their belief contrary to ours being new, is falſe. We force them to acknowledge, that what they hold with us concerning <hi>Infant Baptiſm,</hi> the Baptiſm of Hereticks, and the change of the Sabbath into <hi>Sunday,</hi> of which Scripture makes no mention, they have it onely from Tradition, and the ancient Practice of the Church, and that therefore they reject the anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, becauſe of the Novelty of their Doctrine.</p>
               <p>And this is alſo the great Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that the ancient Fathers made uſe of againſt the Hereticks of their times.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Not but that the Church, which makes no new Articles of Faith, may declare after many Ages, being inſtructed by the Holy Ghoſt, which ſucceſſively teaches her all truth, that certain matters that have not been before examined, whether or not they be Articles of <hi>Faith,</hi> are really ſuch, as ſhe hath done upon many occaſions, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging us to believe diſtinctly what was not as yet known to be matter of Faith.

This ſolid Principle being equally received by Catholicks and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, I hope to ſatisfie both, in declaring calmly and without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, by the bare relation of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent matters of Fact, what the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church hath believed concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the eſtabliſhment of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Prerogatives and rights of her Biſhops. This then is the Method which I ſhall trace in this Treatiſe.</p>

               <p>ALL Catholicks who know that the Popes are the Succeſſours of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> agree amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as to that point, but not with all Hereticks. For there are ſome Modern who confidently deny that that Divine Apoſtle ever was at <hi>Rome,</hi> or that he fixed his Chair ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there or in the City of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och.</hi>

                     <hi>Calvin.</hi> l. 4. Inſt. c. 6.</note> They ground ſo extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and new an Opinion upon the ſilence of St. <hi>Luke</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who having been at <hi>Rome,</hi> would not have failed to have ſpoken of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and to have found Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, if he had already Preached the Goſpel there; beſides, they ground it upon a certain Chronology which they have made, as they thought fit, of the Acts of the Apoſtles, and which can no way agree with that Hiſtory of St. <hi>Peter;</hi> and, in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97808:25"/>fine, upon the very Epiſtles of that Apoſtle, who gives us to know that his Miſſion was into <hi>Aſia,</hi> and that he died at <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is nothing that gives a clearer proof of the weakneſs and deluſion of the wit of man, than when, by that Pride, which is ſo natural to him, he ſhakes off that Authority to which he is obliged to ſubmit, and for that end, oppoſes it by his falſe reaſonings, that ſerve for no other purpoſe but to diſcover his blindneſs and vanity. Though we had elſewhere no Intelligence of the Voyage to, and <hi>Chair</hi> of St. <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Rome;</hi> yet no man of ſenſe would ſuffer himſelf to be perſuaded by ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concluſive arguments, ſo eaſie to be refuted. St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſays nothing of it in the Acts of the Apoſtles: Hath he mentioned there any thing of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Journey into <hi>Arabia,</hi> of his return to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and then three years after to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> of his Travels into <hi>Galatia,</hi> his being raviſhed up into Heaven, his three Shipwrecks, his eight Scourgings,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97808:25"/>and of a thouſand things elſe that he ſuffered? ſhall one conclude from that ſilence, that all is falſe? And though St. <hi>Paul</hi> had not written of theſe things himſelf, or if his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to the <hi>Galatians</hi> and <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Galat.</hi> 1. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.</note> had never come to our hands, would that ſilence of St. <hi>Luke</hi> have been of any greater force, to prove that that is not true, ſeeing it is really ſo, and was true before St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote any thing of it? That Evangeliſt, ſaith St. <hi>Jerome</hi> hath paſt over a great many things which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſuffered, as likewiſe that St. <hi>Peter</hi> eſtabliſhed his Chair firſt at <hi>Antioch,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Ep. ad <hi>Galat.</hi> c. 2.</note> and then at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as to the Chronology calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to refute the two Foundations of <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> we maintain that it is falſe; and it is eaſie to give another fixed by the ableſt wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory and Chronologers, which perfectly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with the Acts of the Apoſtles, and the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St.

                  <hi>Paul:</hi> Take it thus then in a few words.</p>
               <p>The year of our Lord thirty five; that Apoſtle was ſent with St. <hi>John</hi> to <hi>Samaria,</hi>

But an Angel delivered him out of his hands, and brought him forth out of Priſon. After that, this Apoſtle paſt by <hi>Antioch</hi> into the leſſer <hi>Aſia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Petr.</hi> Epiſt. Metaph. ex Antiq.</note> where he ſpent moſt part
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97808:27"/>of that year, inſtructing the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and erecting <hi>Sees</hi> in <hi>Cappado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia, Galatia, Pontus</hi> and <hi>Bithynia;</hi> And having from thence embarked for <hi>Rome,</hi> according to the orders he had received from the Holy Ghoſt, he arrived there about the end of that ſecond year of <hi>Claudius,</hi> as all the moſt ancient Authours who have written of St. <hi>Peter</hi> do agree.</p>
               <p>In that capital City of the world, after he had converted a ſufficient number of Jews and Gentiles for founding a Church, he eſtabliſhed the year following, which was the fourty fifth of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> his Pontifical Chair,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno.</hi> 45.</note> leaving that of <hi>Antioch</hi> to <hi>Evodius,</hi> and there he held it till the conſummation of his Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that he ſuffered in the year threeſcore and nine, which was the thirteenth of the Empire of <hi>Nero.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 69.</note> So that reckoning from the year thirty nine, to fourty five, we ſhall find that St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s See con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſeven years at <hi>Antioch;</hi> and from fourty five to threeſcore and nine when he ſuffered Martyrdom,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97808:28"/>we have the twenty five years of his Epiſcopacy at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not that he lived there conſtantly during all that time, no more than he did at <hi>Antioch,</hi> all the ſeven years that he was Biſhop there. For ſeeing he was both an Apoſtle and a Biſhop, he travelled often, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Vocation of his Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, into divers Countries of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> there to plant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; and as Biſhop he governed his own, either Perſonally, or by his Vicars during his abſence: So that the quality of an Apoſtle is not at all inconſiſtent with that of a Biſhop: And if all Biſhops be not Apoſtles, all the Apoſtles were Biſhops, and ordained Biſhops; And for that reaſon it is that all theſe are the Succeſſours of the Apoſtles. St. <hi>Peter</hi> however, ſince no man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him had Preached the Goſpel at <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Oroſ. <hi>l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 6.</note> lived there ſeven years, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the year fifty one, when he was forced to leave it becauſe of the Edict of the Emperour <hi>Claudius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sueton. <hi>in</hi> Claud.</note> who baniſhed thence the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:97808:28"/>That obliged him to return into <hi>Aſia;</hi> And it is certain that he was again at <hi>Antioch,</hi> where he had a great conteſt with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> either before,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 18. v. 2. <hi>Galat.</hi> 2. v. 11.</note> or after the Council of the Apoſtles, where he was preſent, and which was held the ſame year at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now ſeeing after that Council St. <hi>Peter</hi> could not return to <hi>Rome</hi> during the life of the Emperour who had baniſhed him thence, and that all the other Apoſtles almoſt, had had their Provinces in the Kingdoms of the Eaſt; he took that time to go Preach the Goſpel to the Nations of the Weſt, even thoſe moſt remote: For ſome have written that he went as far as <hi>England.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Metaph.</hi> ex Antiq. <hi>Orig.</hi> praef. in Epiſt. ad <hi>Rom. Theodor.</hi> &amp; alii.</note> So that when St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote from <hi>Corinth,</hi> and not from <hi>Raguſa</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> in the year fifty eight, and when next year after, he was carried Priſoner to <hi>Rome;</hi> where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued two years, untill the year ſixty one, St. <hi>Peter</hi> was not as yet come back. So nothing can
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97808:29"/>be concluded from the ſilence of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſpeaks not of St. <hi>Peter</hi> no more than St. <hi>Luke</hi> does, who was with St. <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it cannot be ſaid that there were no Chriſtians in that City, when that Apoſtle arrived there, ſeeing he had written to them the year before an excellent Epiſtle, wherein he ſays,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. v. 8.</note> that their faith was ſpoken of throughout the whole world, and that he longed to ſee them, that he might impart to them ſome Spiritual Gifts, to the end they might be eſtabliſhed: which he adds, ſays <hi>Theodoret,</hi> and makes uſe of that word eſtabliſh, becauſe the great St. <hi>Peter</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready Preached unto them the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Theod.</hi> in Epiſt. ad <hi>Rom.</hi> c. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> Beſides that, when St. <hi>Paul</hi> arrived firſt at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Brethren came to meet him, as St. <hi>Luke</hi> mentions,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 28.</note> who in many places of the <hi>Acts</hi> calls the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians by that name; and the chief men amongſt the Jews who came to wait upon him at his Lodging, asked him not what that Sect was,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97808:29"/>as if there had been no Chriſtians at <hi>Rome,</hi> and that they had not learned from them what their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief was, but what he believed, becauſe they ſaw that all who ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that Profeſſion were in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces oppoſed and contradicted. This is a Chronology exactly conform to the Scripture, and that very well agrees with the two Voyages of <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> which is the Queſtion in hand.</p>
               <p>And as to what is objected to us, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> wrote from <hi>Babylon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> c. 5. v. 13.</note> where it is alſo affirmed that he died, there is nothing ſo pitifully weak. For it is ſo clear in that place that <hi>Babylon</hi> ſignifies the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> that that paſſage may even be uſed to prove by Scripture that St. <hi>Peter</hi> hath been at <hi>Rome.</hi> And indeed, it is by the very ſame that <hi>Euſebius</hi> makes it out that that Epiſtle was written at <hi>Rome;</hi>

And what is moſt pleaſant, the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants are pleaſed to give to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <hi>Rome</hi> the name of <hi>Babylon;</hi> and are not ſatisfied that Pagan <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be ſo called by St. <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That being preſuppoſed, and all the weak batteries of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries ſo eaſily overthrown, I had reaſon to ſay, that if we knew not by other means, that St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> had been at <hi>Rome,</hi> yet all the reaſons that are objected againſt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97808:30"/>it, would never perſuade a Man of ſenſe of the contrary. How muſt it be then at preſent, when we have an invincible Argument to convince us of that truth which we ought never to abandon, even though we could not diſentangle our ſelves from the captious Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wherewith they aſſault us? For that can never proceed but from the weakneſs of our mind, and not the defect of the object, which, when it is once certainly known to be true, is neceſſarily ſo always.</p>
               <p>What is that invincible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then, which ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of this truth? It is that which, as I have ſaid, I ſhall em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy throughout this whole <hi>Hiſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Treatiſe,</hi> I mean Antiquity, according to that great Principle which at firſt I laid down; To wit, that that which is newly broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if it be contrary to what hath been believed in the Primitive Church, is falſe, becauſe ancient belief, and that deſcends to us by

                  </note> and ancient Authours, who aſſure us that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Rome;</hi> ſay alſo, that he founded that particular Church. It is true, that many of them joyn St. <hi>Paul</hi> with him in that function, as it is done at preſent; and there is reaſon for ſo doing, becauſe both of them Preached the Goſpel there, in different times, and both at the ſame time Conſecrated that illuſtrious Church by their Martyrdom. But when they ſpeak, as they very often do, of the Epiſcopacy and Chair of <hi>Rome,</hi> they call it ſolely the Chair of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> without joining St. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:97808:33"/>with him. So that it is not to be doubted, but that all Antiquity hath acknowledged St. <hi>Peter,</hi> of all the Apoſtles, to have been the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>

               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:97808:33"/>
               <p>As the Univerſal Church is one, and a body conſtituted of all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches, in union with one principal or chief Church, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and centre of their unity: So there is but one general Chair in the Church, and one Epiſcopacy,<note place="margin">Cathedra una ſuper <hi>Petrum</hi> Domini voce fundata. <hi>Cypr.</hi> Epiſt. <hi>40.

                  </note> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of all the Epiſcopal Chairs, by the communication which they have with the <hi>Head</hi> of that Church, and with that chief Chair whence their unity proceeds. So that, as all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are members of the ſame Church, when they are united to its <hi>Head;</hi> ſo all Biſhops, taken in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and every one in particular, ſit in the ſame Chair, by the communion which they have with him that ſits in that principal Chair, from whence, by that union which they preſerve with it, reſults the unity of the Chair and of Epiſcopacy in the Church.</p>
               <p>But, beſides that, every one of them hath his particular Chair, wherein none of the reſt have any ſhare, as they have all a ſhare in that Chair which is but one in the Univerſal Church. And becauſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97808:34"/>Saint <hi>Peter</hi> is head of it, as we ſhall preſently make it appear, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his particular Chair of <hi>Rome,</hi> but likewiſe that of the whole Church is by the holy Fathers often called the Chair of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> It is in that ſenſe then, that all Biſhops ſit in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair, as all the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of the old Law ſate in the Chair of <hi>Moſes.</hi> But for all that, all Biſhops ſit not in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Chair, no more than his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours in that Chair, ſit in the Chairs of other Biſhops, every one poſſeſſing entirely his own, as a part of the Univerſal Epiſcopacy. And thus alſo is to be underſtood what is ſaid, that all Biſhops are the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> Take it in this manner.</p>
               <p>I have clearly made it out in my <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of the true Church, even according to <hi>Calvin,</hi> and the ableſt of our Proteſtants, that the true mark of the true Church, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhes her from all others, is the perpetuity that will make her conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, without ever failing, to the end
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:97808:34"/>of the World. And ſeeing ſhe is that great Sheep-fold, wherein all believers, who are the ſheep of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> are gathered together into one flock, ſhe cannot ſubſiſt in that unity without there be Paſtours and Sheep; ſome to teach, and others to receive the truths which they are to believe; guides, and people, to be guided; and unleſs theſe paſtours and guides ſucceed one another, without interruption to the end, for governing and guiding believers.</p>
               <p>Now that is not to be ſeen but in the Catholick Church, by the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that all theſe particular Churches and their Biſhops have with him whom they own for their <hi>Head.</hi> For in what time ſoever theſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches began to be planted, ſome ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſome later, they may aſcend, by virtue of that Union, through a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Succeſſion, from Paſtours to Paſtours, and from Biſhops to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, till they come to him whom <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath given them for <hi>Head.</hi> And becauſe St. <hi>Peter</hi> is he, as we ſhall preſently ſee; it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:97808:35"/>that it is by that that they are his Succeſſours; ſince by the Union which they have with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> their Head, who, in a ſtreight line, ſucceeds to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> they mount up, without interruption, by a continuity and collateral Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, even to that <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> as all the branches of a Tree are united to the root in oblique and indirect lines, by the union with the trunk and body of that Tree.

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the Primacy of St, <hi>Peter,</hi> and that he hath been eſtabliſhed by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> head of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church.</head>
               <p>I Shall not enlarge in a long diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this point, which the great and large volumes that ſo many lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men of the paſt and preſent age have compoſed for clearing of it, have drained, in alledging all that ſolidly can be ſaid, as to this Article of our Faith, on which depends that perfect unity, which we avow to be eſſential to the Church. I ſhall onely ſay what all Catholicks agree in, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> choſe St. <hi>Peter,</hi> amongſt all his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> to give him, not onely the Primacy of order, honour and rank, by aſſigning him the firſt place, as one chief in dignity amongſt his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals; and in thoſe gifts, talents and graces which are inſeparable from the Apoſtleſhip and Epiſcopacy; but alſo the Primacy of Juriſdiction,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97808:36"/>Power and Authority over all belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the whole Church, of whom he appointed him head.</p>
               <p>This they learn from the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> in that famous paſſage of the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Chapter of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> where St. <hi>Peter,</hi> having anſwered for all the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to our Saviour, who had asked them, what they thought of him, <hi>Thou art the Chriſt the Son of the living God:</hi> our heavenly Lord, commending his faith, ſaid to him, <hi>Bleſſed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for fleſh and bloud hath not revealed it unto thee, but my father which is in heaven. And I ſay unto thee that thou art Cephas</hi> (that is to ſay, in the Syriack Tongue, a <hi>Stone</hi>) <hi>and upon this rock I will build my Church: and the gates of hell ſhall not prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. And I will give unto thee the Keyes of the kingdom of heaven; and whatſoever thou ſhalt bind on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven; and whatſoever thou ſhalt looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed in heaven.</hi>

                  </note> There are others, particularly ſince the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> who, to confute the impiety of the <hi>Arians,</hi> have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood them of that illuſtrious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith that St. <hi>Peter</hi> made, when he ſaid, <hi>Thou art the Chriſt, the Son of the living God;</hi> and ſome have referred them to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf, who is the foundation and corner Stone, of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, That no man can lay another than that which is already laid, which is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But beſides, that the ſame Authours ſay elſewhere, that the Church is founded on St. <hi>Peter,</hi> it is eaſie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile all theſe opinions together, which, without any difficulty, may be reduced to one, that reſults from all the three, by ſaying, that theſe words ought to be underſtood of the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:97808:37"/>perſon of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> confeſſing <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to be the Son of the living God. It is evident, that theſe three inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations naturally reſolve into this, which comprehends the Faith of the Divinity of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Faith, and the perſon who made that confeſſion.</p>
               <p>Now ſeeing the Church is the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of true Chriſtians, and that the firſt object of the Faith of Chriſtians, as <hi>Chriſtians,</hi>

               <p>Moreover, as it is not enough to be a true Chriſtian, to believe in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.</note> and to preſerve that Faith in the heart, if we do not alſo confeſs that we believe in him: therefore it is that the Church again is founded upon the confeſſion of the Divinity of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In fine, beſides <hi>Faith</hi> and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick profeſſion of it, the Church alſo, which is the Kingdom of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:97808:37"/>muſt be well governed. For that purpoſe, he hath appointed in it <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,</hi>

                  </note> he gives him that which is proper to himſelf, ſpeaking to him in the ſingular number, for ſetling in his Church, the unity whereof he makes him the principle and foundation, to which all the reſt muſt have a reference, that they may be but one, by the union which they ought neceſſarily to have with their <hi>Head,</hi> without which they neither are, nor can doe any thing.</p>
               <p>For as St. <hi>Peter</hi> was the firſt that publickly confeſſed the Divinity of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which he had by reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and that the reſt knew it not but by his means, and that they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered onely by his mouth, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him on that great occaſion: So <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in conſideration of that primacy of Confeſſion, hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him the primacy over all the reſt, making him their <hi>head,</hi> and that <hi>one,</hi> that original, foundation and principle of unity, upon which he hath built the Church, in regard of its government. So that although all the reſt received Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:97808:39"/>from <hi>Chriſt</hi> the power of binding and looſing, and of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Churches, yet they cannot exerciſe it but by virtue of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they have with St. <hi>Peter,</hi> without which they would continue no longer in unity, nor by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in the Church. And it is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that that the Primacy of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> is founded, and that he is next to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and not as he is, by his own power and virtue, but by commiſſion, the foundation and head of the Church.</p>
               <p>The Proteſtants, who, by a deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Schiſm, not without Hereſie, have gone out of the unity of the Church, by making ſeparation from the Chair of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> which is the principle, original and centre there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; have, in vain, diſputed this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, with all their force, untill this preſent.

               <p>After all, it is ſo evident, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who will have his Church to continue to the end of the World, hath given St. <hi>Peter</hi> the Primacy and Supreme dignity of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Head of the Church, for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and Succeſſours, in that Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Chair which that great <hi>Apoſtle</hi> fixed at <hi>Rome,</hi> that it would be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous to attempt to prove it.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, Is it not well known that it is an order naturally fixed in lawfull Succeſſions, that Kings and other Princes, and their Officers, in the Civil State; Biſhops, Metropolitans, Primates and Patriarchs, nay, and Miniſters amongſt our Proteſtants, ſucceed to the rights and powers of their Predeceſſours?</p>

There is nothing more ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in the Councils and Fathers, where the ſame things that are ſaid of the Primacy of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and of the Prerogatives of his Chair at <hi>Rome,</hi> are in formal terms moſt frequently found repeated to expreſs the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of the Popes, their ſuper-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance in the Univerſal Church, and the ſuperiority of their Chair, and of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to which they declare that all the reſt ought to be united as Lines to their Centre, and as to the ſource of Sacerdotal Unity. And that's the reaſon why we call the Univerſal Church, the Roman-Catholick and Apoſtolick
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:97808:41"/>Church, becauſe all particular Churches, of which that great body is conſtituted, muſt be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in communion with the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> their Head, that ſo they may be Members of the true Church of Jeſus Chriſt, which is no ways <hi>one,</hi> but by that union which maketh its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect unity.</p>
               <p>I have, me thinks, made it hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto clear enough, according to all Antiquity oppoſite to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty of our Proteſtants, what is the belief of Catholicks concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning St. <hi>Peter</hi> and of his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours in his Biſhoprick of <hi>Rome.</hi> We muſt now in order examine, ſticking cloſe to Antiquity againſt all Novelty, what Prerogatives and Rights that Primacy gives to Popes, what it is that all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks agree in, and wherein it is that they differ about that point; and prove by uncontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted matters of Fact, without diſputation, what Antiquity, which

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Concerning the rights and advantages that the Primacy gives to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> over all other Biſhops.</head>
               <p>I Think that point cannot better be decided than by the Decree of the Council of <hi>Florence</hi> in the year 1439. when that famous re-union was made betwixt the Latin and Greek Churches, after many cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated conferences and great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts that happened there during the ſpace of fifteen months, betwixt the learnedſt men of both Churches about that Subject and other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted points. This is the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of the Council. <hi>Item, we define that the Holy Apoſtolick See, and the Pope of</hi> Rome <hi>have the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy over all the world; that the Pope of</hi> Rome <hi>is the Succeſſour of St.</hi> Peter <hi>Prince of the Apoſtles; that he is the true Vicar of Jeſus Chriſt, and Head of all the Church, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:97808:43"/>and Teacher of all Chriſtians; and that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath given him, in the perſon of St.</hi> Peter, <hi>full power of feeding, ruling and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning the univerſal Church, in the manner ſpecified in the Acts of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and holy Canons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For it is preciſely ſo in the Greek, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:97808:43"/>to the intention and words of the Council, as will manifeſtly appear in another place of this Treatiſe.</p>
               <p>At preſent it is enough that we know, according to that Council, that the Primacy of the Pope enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles him to the inſpection of all that concerns the government and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the Church in general, which is more than any Biſhop of what dignity ſoever he may be can challenge. For the power that other Biſhops have by Divine Right to govern the Church, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches not beyond their Dioceſes: but that of the Pope, as Head of the Church Univerſal, extends every where, when the good of all Believers in general is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; of whom he is to take the care; And that ſupreme dignity gives him a great many rights, which none but he alone can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy.</p>
               <p>To him application is made to have reſolutions in difficulties that may ariſe in matters concerning <hi>Faith,</hi>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:97808:44"/>Of this we have evident proofs in the Holy Fathers, and an illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inſtance of it hath been ſeen in our days, in that famous letter which the Biſhops of <hi>France</hi> wrote to Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> X.</p>
               <p>He alone hath the right of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Councils for Spiritual Affairs, and to preſide in them perſonally, or by his Legates, I ſay he hath that right, without ſpeaking of matter of Fact, which is under debate in reſpect of ſome Councils, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prejudice his Primacy. For though he hath not preſided in the firſt Council of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which perhaps neither did he call, and that it be moſt certain that he did not call the fifth, nor preſided in it, though he was at <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> where that Council was held: yet it is not to be doubted but he might have done both the one and the other, if he had pleaſed, ſeeing that in the Letter which the Patriarch <hi>Entychius</hi> wrote to him for obtaining of that Council,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Concil.</hi> 5. <hi>Act.</hi> 1.</note> he prayed him to preſide in it, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:97808:44"/>that he onely preſided therein upon his refuſal. For thus it is in the Original, <hi>praeſidente nobis veſtrâ beatitudine,</hi> and not <hi>reſidente nobiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> as the Miniſter <hi>Junius</hi> hath corrupted it, by a correction made of his own head, againſt the clear ſenſe of the following words.</p>
               <p>Beſides, is it not paſt all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie that the Pope preſided by his Legates in the Council of <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> as he hath done in almoſt all the others which have been held ſince? For I ſpeak not here of the great Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> nor of that of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> becauſe, as I conceive, I have elſewhere proved by invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Arguments, not onely againſt our Proteſtants, but alſo againſt the ſentiments of ſome Catholick Doctours, that the Popes by their Legates preſided in them, nay, and that they called them, as to what relates to the Spiritual Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which they have over the Biſhops; as the Emperours, to whoſe rights <hi>Kings</hi> and Chriſtian <hi>Princes</hi> have ſucceeded, may call
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:97808:45"/>Councils in regard of <hi>Temporals,</hi> by that ſovereign power which they have received from God over their Subjects, in virtue whereof they may oblige their Biſhops to aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in a certain place, either within or without their Territories, there to treat of matters purely ſpiritual, wherein they meddle not, but as protectours of the Church, in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Decrees and Canons of theſe Councils which ſtrike not at the Rights of their Crown, to be put in execution. It is certain then that the Popes, as Heads of the Church, have right to call general Councils, and to preſide in them.</p>
               <p>Moreover, ſeeing the Pope in that quality,<note place="margin">

It belongs to him to judge of greater Cauſes, ſuch as thoſe which concern the <hi>Faith,</hi> and that are doubtfull, univerſal
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:97808:45"/>Cuſtoms, the depoſing of Biſhops, and ſome others which I have obſerved elſewhere, the deciſion whereof belongs and ought to be referred to him. In that manner the Inferiour Judges appointed by <hi>Moſes</hi> according to the advice of <hi>Jethro,</hi>

               <p>Hence it is alſo that the Pope hath right to judge, yet always according to the diſpoſition of the Canons, of the cauſes of Biſhops, Metropolitans, Primates and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs.

               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:97808:46"/>
               <p>Beſides, that naughty man was both a frank Heretick, and great Cheat.

               <p>This without doubt is one of the moſt illuſtrious marks, and one of the ſtrongeſt proofs of the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:97808:47"/>of the Holy <hi>See,</hi> and of the Primacy of the Pope, that ever was ſeen in the Church.

               <p>And which is ſtill more wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, <hi>Juſtinian</hi> acknowledging that Supreme Authority of the Pope, to which he ſubmitted and joyning thereto his own, as Protectour of the Canons, for cauſing that to be put in execution, made againſt <hi>Anthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi> that famous conſtitution, which is to be ſeen in his two and fourtieth <hi>Novel,</hi> in the tenth colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Authenticks, wherein he poſitively ſays that he hath been juſtly Depoſed by the Pope, as well becauſe he had intruded,<note place="margin">Neque ipſe abdicare auctores impiorum dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matum, qui prius à Sanctis Synodis per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſi fuerant.

               <p>But before I conclude, I muſt, upon occaſion of this Council of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> under <hi>Mennas,</hi> ſhew the Prodigious ignorance of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> in relation to the Hiſtory of the Ancient Church. I have ſaid
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:97808:49"/>in the Hiſtory of <hi>Calviniſm,</hi> and I ſay it again that that man having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver entered the Schools of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, underſtood nothing at all in that Sacred Science; which is a Key abſolutely neceſſary for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locking the ſentiments and ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Holy Fathers, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Principles of true Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy; as they are to be found in a lovely order in the Maſter of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. But it is to be confeſſed that his ignorance appears incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably more pitifull, when he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to prove his new Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by <hi>Church</hi> Hiſtory, in which he was never verſed. Take this as an evident proof of it.</p>
               <p>This Innovatour, who ſtrikes chiefly at the Primacy of the Pope, ſays in that place, for overthrowing it,<note place="margin">Calvin. <hi>Inſt. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 7.</note> that <hi>Mennas</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided in the fifth Council, and that the Pope being called to it, did not conteſt with him about the place of Honour, but without difficulty

               </p>
               <p>Such was the ignorance of the head of our Proteſtants in Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Hiſtory. I do not at all won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at it; for that was none of his ſtudy. But I am aſtoniſhed to ſee, that men of wit and learning dance to his Pipe, in that they implicite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſent to his ignorance in Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, when in the ſyſteme of his hereſie, he rejects matters that are manifeſtly authoriſed by Tradition and Hiſtory, which is the Court of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:97808:51"/>Record of it; nay, even when he traces it back to the Primitive A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Church, wherein they are forced to confeſs, that it was in its purity.</p>
               <p>There are evident proofs of this in the Hiſtory of the Fathers and Councils, where, ſetting aſide ſome frivolous ſuperſtitions of weak peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which we condemn, it may be ſeen, that the ancient Church belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and did, what Catholicks believe and practiſe concerning the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, the Sacrifice of the Maſs, the ſeven Sacraments, the Conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of Grace with Free-will, the Authority of Tradition, the Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saints, Churches dedicated and conſecrated to God in memory of them, the Veneration of their Relicks and Images, Prayer for the dead, the Faſts of <hi>Lent</hi> and of the <hi>Ember weeks,</hi> the diſtinction of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly days and working days, that of the Habits of Lay-men and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the ſingle life of the Clergy, Vows, Sacred Ceremonies in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration and uſe of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

               </p>
               <p>This the famous Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> made out by unqueſtionable teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, in his Reply to the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> where he ſhews, the conformity of the Ancient Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church with ours, in the Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Chapter of the firſt Book, and throughout the whole Third, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Books of that Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Work. And to which alſo <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid Blondel,</hi> a Man incomparably more able than <hi>Calvin,</hi> eſpecially in the knowledge of Antiquity, thought it not fit to make an Anſwer in that overgrown Volume which he wrote againſt the <hi>Reply,</hi> and wherein he thought it convenient to begin his pretended refutation onely at the Three and twentieth Chapter of the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:97808:52"/>firſt Book; and to end it with the Four and thirtieth of the ſame Book.</p>
               <p>But to paſs by the Proteſtants, againſt whom I pretend not to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; It is enough to me, that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, without any diſputation, I have proved by Antiquity alone, the Primacy of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and of the Popes his ſucceſſours in the Chair of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Prerogatives and Rights which are inſeparable from that Primacy, wherein all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks agree. However, it is very well known, that at preſent, they are not all of the ſame mind, as to certain other Prerogatives, which ſome grant, and others will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to him; and eſpecially theſe four, which are, Infallibility, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority over a General Council, the Abſolute Power of Governing the Church independantly of the Canons, and the Direct or Indirect Power over <hi>Temporals.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I muſt now, without deviating from my Principle drawn from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, make appear, without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:97808:52"/>and reaſoning, but as a bare Relater of the ſentiments of the Councils and Fathers, nay and of the Popes themſelves, what venerable Antiquity hath always believed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe points.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> The Queſtion ſtated concerning the Infallibility of the Pope.</head>
               <p>THE Queſtion here is not to know, whether the Pope, as a private Doctour, and onely giving his opinion and thought of a point of Doctrine, concerning Faith and Manners, may be deceived: for it was never doubted, but that in that quality he ſpeaks onely as another Man, and that by conſequent through the weakneſs and infirmity which is incident to all Men, he is ſubject to Errour, according to the ſaying of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Omnis homo mendax.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is it the queſtion, neither to enquire, whether he be infallible when he pronounces from the Chair of the Univerſal Church, jointly, with the Members that are ſubject to him as to their head, whether it be in a General Council where he preſides in perſon, or by his Legats, or with the conſent of the greateſt
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:97808:53"/>part of Catholick Churches and Biſhops. For as we all allow, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath given the gift of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility to his Church, and to a Council which repreſents it, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining Sovereignly, by the Word of God, the differences that might ariſe amongſt Catholicks concerning theſe points of Doctrine: ſo we do confeſs, that when the Pope ſpeaks and decides in that manner, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which he may ſay, <hi>Viſum eſt Spiritui Sancto &amp; nobis;</hi> his words and deciſions are Oracles, and he can in no ways be deceived. As to this there is no diſagreement amongſt Catholicks.</p>
               <p>The queſtion then that may be debated, is to know, whether when he ſpeaks from his Chair of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Maſter and Teacher of all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and having well examined the point in hand, in ſeveral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, his Conſiſtory, or his Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of his Suffragans, of his Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals and Doctours, nay, and having conſulted Univerſities, and by moſt publick and ſolemn Prayers begg'd
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:97808:54"/>the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt; he teaches all Chriſtians, defines, propoſes to the whole Church, by a <hi>Bull</hi> or Conſtitution, what Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are to believe; whether, I ſay, when he pronounces in this manner, he be Infallible or not, and whether his Judgment given and declared in that manner, may not be correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by an Univerſal Council. And this, methinks, is all that can be ſaid, in clear and formal terms, as to the ſtate of this formal queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>And it is the very ſame, about which all Catholick Doctours do not agree. For moſt part of the Doctours on t'other ſide of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> eſpecially the famous Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals <hi>Cajetan, Baronius</hi> and <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> and all the Authours who have followed them, will have the Pope in that caſe, when he declares ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly to all Believers, by his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, what they are to believe, as to any controverted point, to be no ways liable to a miſtake.</p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:97808:54"/>
               <p>On the contrary, an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the moſt noted Doctours of their time, as <hi>Gerſon, Major, Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> the Faculty of Theologie of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> ſo often and ſo publickly prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Popes, and all <hi>France,</hi> as it is even acknowledged by the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours <hi>Navarr, Victoria</hi> and <hi>John Celaia</hi> Spaniards; <hi>Denis</hi> the <hi>Carthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian, Toſtatus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Avila</hi> in his Commentaries upon St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and in the ſecond part of his <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorium, Thomas Illyrius</hi> a <hi>Cordelier,</hi> in his <hi>Buckler</hi> againſt <hi>Luther,</hi> which he dedicated to Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> VI. The Cardinals of <hi>Cuſa,</hi> of <hi>Cambray,</hi> and of <hi>Florence,</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>France</hi> in their Aſſembly repreſenting the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was Pope, Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> VI. when he was Profeſſour at <hi>Louvain,</hi> in his <hi>Commentary</hi> upon the <hi>Fourth of the Sentences,</hi> which he cauſed to be reprinted at <hi>Rome</hi> when he was Pope, without any alterations, and a thouſand other moſt Catholick Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of the Univerſities of <hi>France, Germany, Poland,</hi> and of the <hi>Low
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:97808:55"/>Countries,</hi> who have all very well defended the Primacy of the Pope; all theſe, I ſay, maintain, that he is not Infallible, if he do not pronounce in a General Council, or with the conſent of the Church.</p>
               <p>The diverſity of Sentiments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Catholicks about that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, is then a matter of fact not to be queſtion'd. But what part are we beſt to take in this diſpute, as the moſt rational and beſt grounded? that's a queſtion which I ought not to anſwer, according to the deſign I have taken, and the method that I have propoſed to my ſelf in this <hi>Treatiſe.</hi> I ſhall onely then barely relate what hath been believed as to that in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, and I ſhall do it without touching at the matter of <hi>Right,</hi> but onely faithfully producing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controverted matters of fact, which make appear what the belief of the Ancient Church was concerning that Point.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THAT Action which was of great importance, and which notwithſtanding is not mentioned by St. <hi>Luke</hi> in the <hi>Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> is related by St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, in a very few, but very ſignificant words. <hi>But when Peter,</hi> ſays he,<note place="margin">Galat. c. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> in the ſecond Chapter of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians, was come to Antioch, I withſtood him to the face, becauſe he was to be blamed. For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew, and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf, fearing them which were of the circumciſion. And the other Jews diſſembled likewiſe with him, inſomuch that Barnabas alſo was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with their diſſimulation. But when I ſaw that they walked not uprightly, according to the truth of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:97808:56"/>the Goſpel, I ſaid unto Peter, if thou being a Jew, liveſt after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compelleſt thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is evident, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> in that place rebukes St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and that ſharply too, and that he not onely relates what he ſaid unto him upon that occaſion, but alſo aſſures us, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was to be blamed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently had erred. Now, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in had he erred according to Saint <hi>Paul?</hi> It was not that he had lived with <hi>Jews</hi> according to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi>

                     <hi>Act.</hi> 16.18.21.</note> oftner than once, obſerved them. But it was, in that he withdrew himſelf from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Gentiles, and that living no longer with them, for fear of offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe <hi>Jews</hi> that were come from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he gave occaſion to the other <hi>Jews</hi> and converted <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:97808:56"/>to think, that they were ſtill obliged to obſerve the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The truth is, ſome of theſe new Chriſtians amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 15.</note> who were lately come to <hi>Antioch,</hi> had cauſed a great deal of trouble in that Church, becauſe they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that all who had embraced the Faith of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be Circumciſed, if they were not ſo before, and to obſerve the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> without which they could not be ſaved. St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Barnabas,</hi> who at that time ſtill Preached the Goſpel at <hi>Antioch,</hi> with all their might withſtood thoſe falſe Apoſtles, and taught the contrary. But when thoſe poor Chriſtians of Gentiliſm ſaw that the Prince of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who had far greater autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity than St. <hi>Paul</hi> had, wholly chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his conduct after the arrival of theſe <hi>Jews;</hi> that he ate no more of meats prohibited by the Law; and that thoſe of <hi>Antioch,</hi> who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from Judaiſm, and even <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas,</hi> who was before for the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Goſpel, did the ſame as
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:97808:57"/>Saint <hi>Peter</hi> did, and ſeparated from them, they thought that they onely did ſo, becauſe it was in reality found that theſe legal obſervations were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation, and that they were obliged to keep them as well as the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that made St. <hi>Paul</hi> tell Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> that he compelled the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted <hi>Gentiles</hi> to Judaiſe, becauſe, by his example, which is a ſtronger and far more perſuaſive argument than words are, he gave them to know, that for all they were Chriſtians, yet they were ſtill obliged to obſerve the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which is contrary to the Goſpel of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whoſe yoke is eaſie, and who by the New Law of Grace hath put us in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect liberty of the Sons of God. And therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> on that occaſion ſaid, That St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and thoſe who adhered to him in that conduct which made the converted <hi>Gentiles</hi> to err, walked not upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to the truth of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>

               <p>After that wicked <hi>Neſtorius</hi> had been condemned in the Council of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> ſome of his party publiſhed certain Writings of <hi>Theodore</hi> of <hi>Mopſueſtia,</hi>

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:97808:59"/>which that <hi>Hereſiarch</hi> had uſed, he ſaid almoſt the ſame thing, making it apparent enough, that by the two natures which he admitted to be in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> he underſtood two diſtinct Perſons. But ſeeing that errour was not expreſſed in ſuch formal termes, that all men might diſcover it, and that beſides, this ſame <hi>Theodore</hi> had, in his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, been held in great veneration: that, as it commonly happens, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned great debates; ſome, as <hi>John</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> ſaying that there was nothing to be found fault with in his Book: Others, who were headed by <hi>Rabula</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Edeſſa,</hi> maintaining, that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained pure <hi>Neſtorianiſm</hi> a little diſguiſed.</p>
               <p>This diſpute growing hotter after the death of <hi>Rabula, Ibas,</hi> who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him in the Biſhoprick of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſa,</hi> taking a courſe quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his Predeceſſour, wrote a long Letter to <hi>Maris Perſan</hi> a <hi>Neſtorian</hi> Heretick, wherein he thought it
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:97808:59"/>not enough to give great praiſes to <hi>Theodore,</hi> but inveighs alſo ſharply againſt St. <hi>Cyrill</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the ſcourge of <hi>Neſtorianiſm,</hi> though at the ſame time he condemns the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of <hi>Neſtorius;</hi> whether he ſpake ſincerely, or that he would thereby caution himſelf againſt the proceſs that might have been brought againſt him, for that he had ſo openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared for <hi>Theodore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The truth is, ſometime after he was accuſed in the famous Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> where that Letter was produc'd againſt him,<note place="margin">

But ſeeing there was nothing to be found in it but prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of <hi>Theodore,</hi> whoſe Book had not been examined, and invectives againſt the perſon and conduct of St. <hi>Cyril;</hi> and beſides, that <hi>Ibas</hi> in that Council pronounced Anathema againſt <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> and condemned his Doctrine, more ſeverely than he had even done in his Letter: He was Abſolved, as well as <hi>Theodoret,</hi> who did the ſame, though he had

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ann.</hi> 546.</note> This Prince, who at that time deſired nothing more than the Peace of the Church, zealouſly undertook that affair. He made an Edict againſt theſe <hi>Three Chapters,</hi>

                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:97808:60"/>having driven the <hi>Goths</hi> out of it, he made Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> come to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> that he might oblige him to ſign it as the other Patriarchs of the Eaſt had done.</p>
               <p>There is nothing in Hiſtory more extraordinary, than the fortune of that Pope.

               </p>
               <p>In this condition was he then when the Emperour called him to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to approve the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the <hi>Three Chapters.</hi> He had much adoe to reſolve upon it,<note place="margin">Forundus Hermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anen.</note> becauſe he thought, as many <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentals</hi> did, that that was to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> which had received <hi>Ibas</hi> and <hi>Theodoret,</hi> the defenders of <hi>Theodore</hi> of <hi>Mopſueſtia.</hi> But it was repreſented to him, that the Council had not received them untill they had condemned the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians,</hi> and that it had not exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned neither the Book of <hi>Theodore,</hi> nor that of <hi>Theodoret;</hi> and that, ſeeing now they were ſufficiently convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and perſuaded, that the Doctrine of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> condemned in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:97808:61"/>of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> was contained in theſe Writings, he ought to condemn them, thereby to take all advantage from the <hi>Neſtorians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vigilius,</hi> at length,<note place="margin">Ann. <hi>547.</hi> Judicatum.</note> acquieſced to theſe Remonſtrances, and the year following made his <hi>Decree,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he condemns the <hi>Three Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> but with this reſerve, <hi>Saving the reſpect and ſubmiſſion which is due to the Council of</hi> Chalcedon. <hi>Juſtini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> not ſatisfied with that, would have the Pope, ſeeing the queſtion concerned not that Council, which had not examined theſe Books, to condemn them abſolutely, and without that modification, leſt the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> might make uſe of it for eluding a like condemnation.

               <p>In fine, after many debates about the ſubject, <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> who reſolved

               <p>He moreover confirms that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument by the examples of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul.

               <p>It is, in my Judgment, very clear, that Pope <hi>Pelagius</hi> in that place ſays plainly, and without biaſs, that as St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> had erred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their change, to which they ought to adhere, ſo <hi>Vigilius</hi> was miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in his conſtitution, whereby he obliges Believers to maintain the Doctrine of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> and that they muſt imitate the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly See in its change,<note place="margin">Quid obſtat, ſi igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantiam ſuam deſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens verba permutet?</note> when having approved them with <hi>Vigilius,</hi> it condemns them, after he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the truth which he knew not before.

I ſhall not undertake to refute and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow his Arguments,<note place="margin">Baron. <hi>ad Ann.</hi> 51. <hi>n.</hi> 39.</note> as ſome think they have done with very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle difficulty. I diſpute not at all in this <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> where I am onely to relate matters of Fact. It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough then that I ſay; It's true that that great Cardinal is of that Judgment, becauſe he believed Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to be infallible; In the mean time St. <hi>Auſtine,</hi> ſo far from belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it, thought he erred five times, when he was in fear of being drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and our Saviour told him,<note place="margin">Et cum in mari ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tubaſſet, &amp; cum do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum carnaliter à paſſione revocaſſet, &amp; cum aurem ſervi gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio praecidiſſet &amp; cum ipſum dominum ter ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſſet, &amp; cum in ſi, mulationem poſtea ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitioſam lapſus eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> de agone Chriſtiano. c. <hi>30.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>O thou of little faith wherefore didſt thou doubt?</hi> when he would have diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him from ſuffering for us, and was rebuked by theſe piercing words, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan;</hi> When he cut off <hi>Malchus</hi> his Ear, and three times denied his Maſter; and laſt of all, when he fell into that fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for which St. <hi>Paul</hi> reproved
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:97808:65"/>him. St. <hi>Auſtine</hi> then, St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> Pope <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and even St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeak poſitively to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary of what <hi>Baronius</hi> ſays, as I have juſt now demonſtrated.</p>
               <p>This has made learned men argue from St. <hi>Auſtine,</hi> who they think cannot be anſwered: Either Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpoke truth, when he ſaid St. <hi>Peter</hi> was to be blamed, that he walked not uprightly according to the truth of the Goſpel, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled the converted <hi>Gentiles</hi> to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daize; or what he ſaid was falſe. If he ſpoke truth, it is then true, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was not Infallible, ſince he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually erred in that particular. If he did not ſpeak truth, it muſt then be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that the <hi>Epiſtle to the Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> which makes a part of H. Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is not the Word of God; which is a manifeſt errour in matter of Faith.</p>
               <p>Again, when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake in that manner, either he thought as he ſpoke, or did not. If he believed what he ſaid to be true, it was his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was not Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. If he believed it not, then muſt
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:97808:65"/>he in the ſame Epiſtle to the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> wherein he proteſts before God that he lied not, have told a lie; which is not to be ſaid with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Blaſphemy, ſince what he writes in that Epiſtle is the Word of God who cannot lie. And thus it is made out, that according to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> thoſe great Saints, and that wiſe Pope, who underſtood himſelf very well, St. <hi>Peter</hi> was guilty of a notable miſtake at that time, when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated to the Jews and Gentiles that they were obliged to keep the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> which the Church immediately after condemned in the Council of the Apoſtles held at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For it is to be obſerved, which a great many have not minded, that, as that Pope whoſe words I have ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, does expreſly ſay, it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Council of the Apoſtles that St. <hi>Peter</hi> did that action which rendred him blame-worthy. And who does not ſee that he had been incomparably more worthy of blame and reproof, if, as Cardinal <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:97808:66"/>will have it, he had done it immediately after the Decree of the Council, which had juſt then defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he himſelf having ſubſcribed to the Decree, that Chriſtians were no more obliged to obſerve thoſe legal Rites, excepting in one ſmall point, and that for a certain time; and that after he had ſpoken ſo well on that ſubject, to free Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans from that Yoke, he ſhould have again endeavoured to ſubject them to it, by obliging them to Judaize? That would have been ſo ſtrange a thing, and ſo unbeſeeming an Apoſtle, and the Prince of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, that I make no doubt but that for the honour that is due to him, it is far better to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in that the judgment of that ancient Pope, than the Opinion of this Cardinal who lived but in the laſt age. It follows then from theſe matters of Fact which I have now moſt faithfully related, that a great Pope, and thoſe Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the moſt venerable and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of Antiquity, have not belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:97808:66"/>even according to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was infallible, nor by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent that the Popes who have no greater privilege and prerogative than St. <hi>Peter</hi> had, have received that gift of Infallibility.</p>

And the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to expreſs that unity, he applies himſelf and ſpeaks to one onely, that is, to the head, to whom he gave the Primacy over the reſt. So that when in that union, or rather that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:97808:67"/>unity, he pronounces and defines jointly with them in a Council, or with conſent of the Church by her Biſhops; he cannot err, the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtands always ſure, and the ſheep are always well governed and well fed.</p>
               <p>But becauſe Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and thoſe who follow him, will have theſe words, <hi>I have prayed for thee,</hi> Peter, <hi>that thy faith fail not,</hi> to be applied abſolutely to the Perſon of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and without relation to the Church which he repreſents by virtue of his Primacy, we muſt grant them what they pretend. For, the truth is, they may be underſtood alſo in that ſenſe: but then they have a very natural and literal mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which is that of almoſt all the ancient Fathers and Interpreters of Holy Scripture, who ſay that in this place our Saviour onely ſpake of the time of his Paſſion, when the Apoſtles were to be terribly tempted, as he himſelf foretold them. Then addreſſing himſelf to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> told him that he had
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:97808:67"/>prayed for him, not that he might not commit any ſin of Infidelity, for he committed a fearfull one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the confeſſion of Faith, by denying his Maſter thrice: but that being recovered from his fall, he might not loſe the Faith for ever, that by the example of his Repentance, he might confirm therein his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who were much ſtartled and ſhaken; and that afterwards he might perſevere unto the end.</p>

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:97808:72"/>fault with his conduct: For they never queſtioned but that thoſe who refuſed to obey an Infallible Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, ought to be condemned and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. It was not then believed in the Church, that the Pope had the gift of Infallibility, though he might make a Decree for the inſtruction of all believers.</p>

               <p>The truth is, <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory remarks, that the true ſtate of that great Queſtion, that was then in agitation, was to know, Whether thoſe who returned from any Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie whatſoever, ought to be Re-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</p>
               <p>Indeed, if one would ſtick, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out admitting any explication, to the natural ſenſe of theſe words of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius, A quocunque Haereſis genere;</hi>

And that is alſo the errour that ſome have attributed unto him upon theſe words, <hi>Si quis à quacunque Haereſi,</hi> which they have taken according to the ſtrictneſs of the Letter. But it is to be confeſſed ingenuouſly, that
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:97808:76"/>as Tradition hath always rejected the Monſtrous Baptiſms of ſome Hereticks, which may be ſeen in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanius,</hi> who Baptized in a quite different manner from what <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> preſcribes, when he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to Baptize in the Name of the <hi>Father,</hi> of the <hi>Son,</hi> and of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> So that Holy Pope, who, with St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all theſe falſe Baptiſms, would onely, that the Baptiſm adminiſtred in the Name of the <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> by any Hereticks what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, ſhould not be reiterated.</p>
               <p>And certainly, without neceſſity of alledging any other proof, that, in my opinion, appears evidently, by that teſtimony of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> which I have juſt now cited: <hi>Stephanus Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmum Chriſti in nullo iterandum eſſe cenſebat: Pope Stephen thought, that the Baptiſm of Jeſus Chriſt was to be reiterated in no Heretick.</hi> The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion was onely then about the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which ordains Baptiſm to be adminiſtred in the Name of the <hi>Father,</hi> and of the <hi>Son,</hi>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:97808:76"/>and of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> would have that to ſtand good by what Heretick ſoever it had been conferred; and the <hi>Africans</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that it was null, if it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by Hereticks out of the Church, or by Schiſmaticks.

               <p>Here then, we have a Pope of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous memory in the Church, who makes a Decree, whereby he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs all Believers, concerning a point of higheſt importance, where the queſtion is about the validity or nullity of Baptiſm, without which one cannot be ſaved; and by that Decree he pretends to oblige the whole Church to believe, that Hereticks, who are converted, ought not to be Re-baptized, and does ſo pretend it, that he cuts off from his communion great Biſhops, who would not ſubmit to his Decree.

               <p>THESE two holy Popes, <hi>Victor</hi> and <hi>Stephen,</hi> whom ſo many Catholick Biſhops of the Ancient Church have not believed to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, had notwithſtanding the truth on their ſide, and in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours the Councils decided.

                     <hi>Ann.</hi> 357.</note> ſolemnly approved <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm.</hi> This he did, by condemning jointly with the <hi>Arians,</hi> St. <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> the great defender of the Faith, and ſcourge of <hi>Arianiſm;</hi> beſides, by ſuppreſſing the Term <hi>Conſubſtantial,</hi> which diſtinguiſhed a <hi>Catholick</hi> from an <hi>Arian,</hi> and which was, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the Character and Mark of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicity;</hi> nay more, by receiving the moſt obſtinate <hi>Arians</hi> into his Communion; and, in a word, by ſubſcribing to the ſcandalous For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulary of <hi>Sirmium,</hi> which was preſented to him by the Head of the <hi>Semi-Arians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, at length, that it might not be doubted but that he acted as Pope, who makes known to the whole Church what Men ought to believe, for that was the thing the <hi>Arians</hi> pretended to, who were willing it might be known, that the Head of the Church was on their ſide: He Wrote two long Letters, which were

This Pope, before the fifth Council, made a Conſtitution,<note place="margin">

                  </note> which he addreſſed to the Emperour <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> wherein, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other things, undertaking the defence of the Letter of <hi>Ibas</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Edeſſa,</hi> he declares, that according to the words of that Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, underſtood in the ſound ſenſe that might be given unto them, it ſeemed to be Orthodox, and ſtrictly prohibits any whoſoever to innovate any thing touching that Letter, in what manner ſoever it might be; nor to condemn it, ſeeing <hi>Ibas</hi> had been abſolv'd, and received as a

               </p>
               <p>There you have two decrees quite contrary one to another. Whence it muſt follow, that either the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil in its deciſion, or the Pope in his conſtitution, are deceived, and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:97808:88"/>maintain an errour. Or whether that Pope did at length conſent to that Council, as I have ſaid, upon the credit of very good vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, or that he never conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it, as there are ſome who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm: It is certain, that his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, <hi>Pelagius</hi> II. and St. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great have approved it, and that it hath always been received ſince without contradiction, by all the Weſtern Church, as a true Ecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical Council which cannot err. It is then moſt certain that <hi>Vigilius</hi> decided wrong in his conſtitution, and that by conſequent, even accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Popes and Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the fifth Age; The Popes, for all they are heads of the Church, are not therefore Infallible.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Theſe are matters of fact to be read in the Councils, and in the Books which I cite; and they are ſo ſtrong and deciſive againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the Pope, that <hi>Baroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Bellarmine, Pighius,</hi> and the other modern Authours, who will abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely have the Pope to be Infallible, have been forced to deliver them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the perſecution of thoſe troubleſome matters of fact, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge forgery in them, and boldly to ſay, that the Acts of the Sixth Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil have been corrupted by <hi>Theodore</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who, in hatred to the Popes, foiſted in, immediately after the Council, all that concerns <hi>Honorius;</hi> and that the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> of St. <hi>Leo</hi> are falſe, and have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by ſome Impoſtour, an enemy of the Holy See. For, ſay they, what likelihood, that after the Letter of Pope <hi>Agatho</hi> had been read in the fourth Action, wherein he ſayth, That the Apoſtolical Church hath
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:97808:94"/>never ſwerved from the truth, they would have condemned one of his Predeceſſours, and that <hi>Leo</hi> his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour ſhould doe the ſame?</p>
               <p>But they who yield not to that reaſon, nor to ſome other conjectures which they find to be weaker, object reaſons againſt them, which they think can never be anſwer'd. For, ſay they, if that wicked Patriarch had corrupted the Acts, would not the Popes Legats, who preſided in the Council, and brought a Copy of them to <hi>Rome,</hi> have clearly ſeen the Impoſture, and that what was inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed concerning Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> was no Act of the Council, which had not mentioned him? Would they not have complained to the Emperour of that horrid Cheat? Would they not have told Pope <hi>Leo</hi> that theſe Acts were falſified? Would they have ſuffered, without ſpeaking one word, that he ſhould have Tranſlated them in that manner, to impoſe upon the whole Church? And would the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, who was himſelf preſent at the Council, put into his Edict, that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:97808:95"/>
                  <hi>Honorius</hi> had been condemned there, or at leaſt would he have ſuffered that Edict to be falſified in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence?</p>
               <p>Now if any one, to excuſe the Legats and Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> ſhould think fit to ſay, That theſe Acts were not corrupted till long after their death; Might not his mouth be ſtopt with this Reply; To what end then was that Impoſture? Was there not to be found in the Records of the <hi>Vati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> the true Copy of that Council, the Tranſlation of it made by Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> and beſides, a Thouſand Copies of it elſewhere, which might have been oppoſed to thoſe Falſaries for diſcovering their Cheat? Would not Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> very far from Writing to the Fathers of the Eighth Council, that <hi>Honorius</hi> had been condemned in the Sixth, have advertiſed them, that their Copies were corrupted? Durſt the Fathers have renewed the <hi>Anathema</hi> againſt <hi>Honorius,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi>'s three Legats never have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it? Yet they did no ſuch thing, and there was no complaint made at
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:97808:95"/>that time that the Acts of the Sixth Council were falſified, becauſe there have never been any other Copies of theſe Acts, either in Writing or in Print, except thoſe which we have, wherein <hi>Honorius</hi> is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with <hi>Sergius</hi> and <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> and the other heads of the <hi>Monothelites.</hi>

That is a little work of the Deacon <hi>Agatho</hi> Keeper of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, and Vice-Chancellour of the Church of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> For he ſaith there, that Officiating as Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary in the Sixth Council, he Tranſcribed all the Acts with his own hand, which were carefully kept in the Imperial Palace, and that by the command of the Emperour he took five Copies of them, for the five Patriarchs, that ſo the Deciſions of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:97808:96"/>the Council might not be altered: by Conſequent, it was one of theſe Copies which the Legats carried to the Pope, who, without doubt, is the firſt of the five Patriarchs.

               <p>So many convincing evidences make it manifeſtly out, that the Acts of that Council have not been cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the <hi>Greeks.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt part of thoſe that ſaid it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, abandoning ſo weak a defence, have retrenched themſelves behind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, ſaying, That the Fathers were miſtaken, in not having rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:97808:96"/>the ſenſe and meaning of the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> of <hi>Honorius,</hi> who made uſe of a wiſe diſpenſation for uniting and calming all Winds. But that is a worſe and far more dangerous An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer than the former. For it ſtrikes onely at ſome private perſons, who are accuſed, but not known, upon bare conjectures of having falſified the Acts: but the other attacks a whole Ecumenical Council, robbing it of all the authority and force which it ought to have againſt Hereticks.</p>
               <p>The truth is, by the ſame liberty that is taken, to ſay, that the Council hath not rightly underſtood the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Pope <hi>Honorius,</hi> thought it hath examined them, the <hi>Monothelites,</hi> if there were any at preſent, might ſay, That it hath not rightly underſtood the Scriptures, nor the Fathers, upon the credit of whom it pretends to have rightly condemned the doctrine of <hi>Theodore</hi> of <hi>Pharan, Sergius, Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus, Paul</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carius</hi> of <hi>Antioch;</hi> and thereby are made uſeleſs all the Decrees of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and all the Conſtitutions of Popes
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:97808:97"/>received in the Church, which have condemned, as Heretical, certain doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, and certain propoſitions parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly pointed at, and contained in the Books of ſome Authours, as the Fathers of the Fifth Council did, in regard of the <hi>Three Chapters;</hi> and in our time Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> X. and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> VII. in regard of the Book of <hi>Janſenius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are Arguments, which, in my opinion, can never be anſwer'd.

Upon that ground then, I ſay, for an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to both, in the firſt place, that whether the Acts of the Sixth

               <p>This is ſo true, that in the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Breviary</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> printed at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> in the year 1482, and 61 years after at <hi>Paris,</hi> in the Year 1543, after that it is ſaid in the firſt Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſecond Nocturn of the Office of St. <hi>Leo,</hi> on the eight and twentieth of <hi>June, Hic ſuſcepit ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctam ſextam Synodum;</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond it is to be read. <hi>In qua ſynodo damnati ſunt Cyrus &amp; Sergius, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius, Pyrrhus, Paulus,</hi> &amp;c.

Whence it clearly
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:97808:99"/>follows, That Antiquity hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that the Pope was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible. The ſame may be ſaid to thoſe who maintain, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, in condemning the Epiſtles of <hi>Honorius</hi> to <hi>Sergius,</hi> did not rightly underſtand them. Whether that be ſo or no, it is certain, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your ſelves, that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned them: Then a whole great Council of above two hundred Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of the ſeventh Age, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the Univerſal Church in her Paſtors lawfully aſſembled, did not believe the Pope to be Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for had they been of that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, they would have had a care whether they had well or ill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood theſe Letters, not to have anathematiſed him as they did.</p>
               <p>The Reſult of all is, That Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, in the Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Ages, as well as in thoſe that preceded, hath believed that the Pope was not Infallible. This is it that I was to prove; leaving the Modern Doctors who hold his Infallibility, to their Liberty of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:97808:99"/>thinking and ſaying thereupon, whatever they pleaſe, by Logick, that can never overthrow the truth of matters of Fact which I have produced, and which make known to us what Antiquity hath believed concerning the Infallibility of the Pope.</p>

Wherein all the Popes perfectly well agree with the fifth Council; which for proving that neceſſity, alledges the Example of the Apoſtles, who decided in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the Queſtion touching the Obſervation of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nec enim poteſt in communibus de fide diſceptationibus aliter veritas manifestari.</note> and then declares, that otherways Truth cannot be found in Controverſies that ariſe about the Faith. It is evident by that, that the Popes and that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil did not believe that the Pope was infallible: for had they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved him infallible, they would alſo have been perſuaded, that it was ſufficient to conſult that Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:97808:107"/>or, that after his Reſponſes and Deciſions, it would not have been neceſſary, for aboliſhing Error en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, to have recourſe to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the Church repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by a Council.</p>
               <p>But if it be ſaid, that there are ſome Hereſies which the Popes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone have condemned, and which have always been reckoned lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned, without the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of a Council; it is eaſily granted: but at the ſame time it may be ſaid, that that concludes nothing at all, becauſe in the three firſt Ages of the Church there were Hereſies, ſuch as that of <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> of the <hi>Ptolemaits,</hi> the <hi>Severians, Bardeſanites, Noetians, Valeſians,</hi> and many others, that ſingle Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops or particular Synods have condemned, and which we are obliged to account Hereſies, tho neither Popes nor General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils have had any hand in their Condemnation. Not that theſe Biſhops and Synods are infallible, but becauſe all the other Biſhops
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:97808:108"/>who abominated theſe Hereſies as much as they, condemned them as they had done, by approving all that they had done. So when Popes have decided againſt any Doctrine which is afterward to be eſteemed heretical, it is ſo, becauſe they have defined with conſent of the Church, which hath received their Conſtitutions; as we have in our days ſeen an illuſtrious Inſtance of it.</p>
               <p>That which more confirms that ancient Tradition of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, is, the great number of Popes, who condemning ſome of their Predeceſſors, after Oecumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Councils, have thereby decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that they themſelves no more than others, have not received of God the gift of Infallibility, which he hath only beſtowed upon his Church. And indeed, two great Popes of the laſt Times were ſo fully perſuaded of this, that they would not accept of it from the hands of men that would have attributed it unto them.</p>

               <p>Having propoſed the matter to them, by giving them to underſtand, that the Queſtion was about the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding of a Point of very great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, concerning a Sacrament, he declared to them, that he would not have them alledge to him the Examples of his Predeceſſors,<note place="margin">Non dubito quin ego &amp; deceſſores mei er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare aliquando potueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, non ſolum in koc, ſed etiam in pluribus aliis rerum generibus.</note> that he would not follow them, but in ſo far as they were conform to the Authority of Holy Scripture, and ſolid Reaſons of Divinity. <hi>For I make no doubt,</hi> added he, <hi>but that my Predeceſſors and! may fail, not only in this, but in many other things:</hi>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:97808:109"/>Which he even proved by Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Scripture, which teacheth us,<note place="margin">Nec rationem habere ullam exempli quod hic vel ille deceſſor meus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Wherefore, have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Examples, and don't tell me what this man or that man of my Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors have determined about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a like Caſe Confider only whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe Popes have underſtood right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or not what they have decided con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this matter of Marriage which we examine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a Pope, who doubtleſs will never be accuſed of having failed in maintaining the pontifical Authority, that nevertheleſs frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſſes, and in very plain terms, that he and his Predeceſſors may have erred in Deciſions that they may have made concerning points relating to the Faith. So that from all that I have hitherto ſaid upon
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:97808:110"/>that Subject it may evidently be concluded, That great Saints of the ancient Church, Biſhops in all parts of Chriſtendome, in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and in <hi>Africa,</hi> full and general Councils, ancient Popes who have either preſided in or conſented to theſe Councils; in a word, that all Antiquity hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that the Pope deciding by his pontifical Authority, without the conſent of the Church, is not at all infallible.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> The ſtate of the Queſtion touching the Superiority of a Council over the Pope, or of the Pope over a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</head>
               <p>IF I proceeded in this Treatiſe by way of Diſcourſe and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I might ſoon conclude, and not fear that any Objection could be brought againſt my Concluſion: for if Antiquity hath believed as I think I have demonſtrated, that the Pope is not Infallible, and that he may be deceived in his Decrees; it's moſt evident, that it hath alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by neceſſary conſequence, that the Tribunal of the Univerſal Church, which without contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is infallible, and repreſented by a general Council, is above that of the Pope. But becauſe for avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Diſpute, I only alledge evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent matters of Fact, againſt which all the Arguments in the World can never prevail; for, in fine, can
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:97808:111"/>one by dint of Argument make that which has been, never to have been? I ſhall only relate what the Ancient Church hath believed touching that famous Queſtion. Seeing the State of the Queſtion ought plainly and without Ambiguity to be propoſed, for avoiding perplexity, to the end that people may at firſt agree about the thing that is in queſtion, and that it may not be ſaid as it often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happens after much jangling and diſpute without concluding any thing; that the thing was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in a quite different ſenſe than it was propoſed in: Take therefore the ſtate of the Queſtion as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
               <p>It is enquired, Whether after that a Council is lawfully aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, the Pope who without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction is Head of it, preſiding in it in perſon, or by his Legates, or not being preſent nor preſiding therein either the one way or t'other, as it hath happened oftner than once, and is to be ſeen in the ſecond Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical Council of an hundred and<note place="margin">

               <p>In this preciſely conſiſts that Queſtion which hath not been mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Church, but ſince the Council of <hi>Piſa,</hi> ſome two hundred and forty Years ago.<note place="margin">

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:97808:112"/>before, is, becauſe it was not at all doubted in the Ancient Church, but that a Council was above the Pope. I ſhall make it out by matters of Fact, againſt which no Reply can be made.</p>

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:97808:112"/>and when the matter in queſtion had been well examined, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree that paſs'd in that Council proceeded from the Holy Ghoſt, which was uttered in theſe Words, <hi>Viſum eſt ſpiritui ſancto &amp; nobis.</hi> It hath ever ſince alſo been believed, that when other Councils, after an exact Enquiry into the Truth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined what was to be believed, or what was to be done, it is the Holy Ghoſt that ſpeaks in their Decrees; and that it may truly be ſaid, as it was ſaid at <hi>Jeruſalem, It hath ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good to the Holy Ghoſt and to this Aſſembly.</hi> This hath been expreſſed by St. <hi>Leo,</hi> in theſe terms,<note place="margin">Sanctorum patrum canones ſpiritu Dei con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diti, &amp; totius mundi reverentia conſecrati. <hi>St.</hi> Leo <hi>Epiſt. 84. ad Anaſt.

                  </note> which have been received with ſo much Applauſe in the whole Church, when he ſaith in one of his Epiſtles, That the Canons of the holy Fathers have been made by the Spirit of God, and that they are conſecrated by the Veneration of the whole Earth.</p>
               <p>Now it is certain, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> depended upon the Holy Ghoſt as well as St. <hi>James,</hi> St. <hi>John,</hi> St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:97808:113"/>St. <hi>Barnaby,</hi> the Elders, and other Brethren who were preſent in that Council; and if after that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by his Example the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to Judaiſe, as Cardinal <hi>Baroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> hath thought, he had been much more to be blamed for having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed the Holy Ghoſt and the Council, than when St. <hi>Paul</hi> rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him openly before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; as I have made it clearly out by the Teſtimony of the Fathers, and of Pope <hi>Pelagius</hi> II.</p>
               <p>So that it ought to be concluded, that the Pope, who is no leſs inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to the Holy Ghoſt than St. <hi>Peter</hi> to whom he ſucceeds, is obliged to ſubmit to his Judgment againſt his own, to obey and conſent to his Deciſions, and conſequently to thoſe of the Council, who neither ſpeaks nor decides but with the Holy Ghoſt, according to thoſe high Words which contain all the Force, Authority, and Soul of Oecumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Councils; <hi>Viſum eſt ſpiritui ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto &amp; nobis.</hi>

               <p>This is ſo true, that if after the great Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> for example, defined by Plurality of Voices, that the <hi>Word</hi> is conſubſtantial to the Father, the Pope St. <hi>Sylveſter</hi> had not received that definition, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Conſubſtantiality of the <hi>Word,</hi> as the <hi>Arians</hi> did not, he would have been reckoned an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick as well as they. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he failed not to conſent to the Decrees of that Council, by appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and confirming them by his own Aſſent, and by the Aſſent of the Biſhops whom he had aſſembled at <hi>Rome</hi> upon that occaſion. <hi>I offer you,</hi> ſays he, in his Epiſtle to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of <hi>Nice,</hi> if that Letter be true, as Cardinal <hi>Baronius</hi> thinks, <hi>I offer you my Hand, and that of my Diſciples,</hi>

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:97808:114"/>in it. That appears evidently by the Letters of two great Popes; St. <hi>Leo,</hi> and St. <hi>Martin.</hi> The Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> made Decrees concerning the <hi>Faith,</hi> for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the Hereſie of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tycheans,</hi> and the Remains of that of the <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> and by the eight and twentieth Canon thereof, to honour the Imperial City, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place among the Patriarchs was given to the Patriarch of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople:</hi> which is contrary to the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> that diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of it otherways; and to which St. <hi>Leo</hi> alſo would never conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend, what Inſtance ſoever the Fathers of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> made to him for it.</p>

                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:97808:119"/>Is not that to ſay, that to know whether the Deciſions of the Pope proceed from God or not, they muſt be received by the whole Church, and that by conſequent the Council which repreſents it, and which gives them their full force by its ſupreme Authority, is above the Pope?</p>
               <p>This appears ſtill more clearly by one other Inſtance, where it is to be ſeen, that a General Council ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving examined a Judgment ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rendered by the Pope, reſcinds it, and paſſes a contrary Sentence. It is that which the fifth Council pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt the <hi>three Chapters,</hi> and againſt the Conſtitution of Pope <hi>Virgilius,</hi> whereby he had approved them, forbidding all men whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to condemn them. I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſpoken of that Action which ſtandeth not in need of any long diſcourſe to ſet it off in its full Force and Vigour.</p>
               <p>In this Council the Doctrine of the Three Chapters, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Pope who approves
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:97808:119"/>them, are examined. He is prayed to preſide in that Aſſembly, and in the Examination that is made there of theſe Writings. He refuſes, though he was then at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> where the Council was held, and with all his might ſtill maintains thoſe three Chapters; and never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs they are condemned, and are to this day reckoned to have been very lawfully and juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned: nay, he was afterwards neceſſitated to ſubmit to that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, as I have already ſaid upon the Credit of very good Vouchers; and if yet he did not ſubmit to it, it is ſtill certain, that the Council examined his Judgment, and reſcin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it. After that, can it be doubted, but that the ancient Church belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that a Council is ſuperiour to the Pope?</p>
               <p>Let's reflect a little upon what I ſaid of the ſixth Council, which condemned the Hereſie of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothelites.</hi> In it was examined what the Pope St. <hi>Martin</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided concerning that Subject in his
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:97808:120"/>Council of the Biſhops of <hi>Italy</hi> ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated at <hi>Rome,</hi> and what Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> had before him declared, in relation to the ſame Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, in his Epiſtles to <hi>Sergius</hi> Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> one of the chief Authors of that Hereſie. The Judgment of St. <hi>Martin</hi> was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in that Council; and that of <hi>Honorius</hi> ſo ſeverely cenſured, that the Pope was there anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſed. Whether theſe Letters were well or ill underſtood, it makes nothing to our preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. The Council paſſes Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon him, and no body ever objected againſt it in Antiquity. This is ſufficient to conclude in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincibly, that the Council is ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the Pope.</p>
               <p>But is there any thing more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing and deciſive for fixing of this Truth, than what was done in the caſe of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> who by their Schiſm troubled all the Church of <hi>Africa?</hi>

Pope <hi>Miltiades</hi> took for Aſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors in this Judgment, fifteen Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Italy,</hi> to whom he joyned three famous Biſhops of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, <hi>Maternus</hi> of <hi>Cologne, Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticius</hi> of <hi>Autun,</hi> and <hi>Marinus</hi> of <hi>Arles,</hi> whom the Emperour had ſent him to be of the number of the Judges, that the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> might not have cauſe to ſay, that every thing had been refuſed them. That Cauſe was ſolemnly judged in that Council of <hi>Rome.

               <p>They were very willing to be judged by this Council, imagining, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> obſerves,<note place="margin">Ep. 162.</note> that either they might gain their Cauſe by Artifices and Calumnies, or that if they loſt it, yet they might ſtill maintain their Party, by complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loudly in all places, that the Pope and his Biſhops, who were prejudiced againſt them, had judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed partially.

                  </note> as their Anceſtors had done, jeered them pleaſantly, ſaying, that they acted like bad Lawyers, who having loſt their Cauſe blame their Judges, and complain to all men, that they have been unjuſtly condemned, when they have even been convicted by the moſt manifeſt diſcovery of the Truth.<note place="margin">Ecce putemus illos Epiſcopos qui Romae judicarunt non bonos Judices fuiſſe: reſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat adhuc plenarium Eccleſiae <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſalis concilium, ubi etiam cumipſis judicibus cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa poſſet agitari, ut ſi male judicaſſe convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti eſſent, torum ſen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tentiae ſolverentur. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                  </note> Then, to confound them, he adds theſe great Words, which plainly decides the Queſtion that we examine, and to which nothing can be replied: <hi>Suppoſe that the Judges who condemned your Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors at</hi> Rome <hi>had judged amiſs, was not there ſtill the full Council, where that Cauſe might be again examined with the ſame Judges

               </p>
               <p>I freely confeſs, that I cannot ſee how it can be better made out that the Pope's Tribunal is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to that of a full and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council, which may confirm or reſcind a Sentence paſt at <hi>Rome,</hi> as a ſupreme Court can confirm or reſcind the Judgment of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour.

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:97808:127"/>if he offered to do ſo, that he ſhould run a hazard of being depoſed from the Popedom. By whom?

               <p>There are a great many Popes who have expreſſed themſelves as plainly as theſe, that they were ſubject to a Council.

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:97808:128"/>in ſome of my Hiſtories. For that purpoſe, he makes uſe of this paſſage in the Goſpel, where our Saviour ſays to his Diſciples, That if your Brother offend you, reprove him privately, and then in preſence of two or three Witneſſes; and if he amend not, tell the Church of him; and if he obey not the Church, let him be as a Publican and as a Heathen.<note place="margin">Defenſor. p. c. c. 29.</note> The famous and learned <hi>Toſtatus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> employs that Paſſage to prove that the ſupreme and higheſt Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of the Church is that of a Council, to which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred all his Diſciples, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who is therefore ſubject to it as to his lawful Judge, from whom he is to expect the Juſtice that he may demand againſt his Brother.

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:97808:131"/>of the Saints; and if any one have the boldneſs to attempt it, his raſhneſs will never paſs unpuniſhed.</p>
               <p>Perhaps if at <hi>Rome</hi> they had made any Reflexion on this Epiſtle, when it was reſolved there to have an Arm of the Body of St. <hi>Francis Xavier,</hi> the Apoſtle of the <hi>Indies,</hi> which was then to be ſeen at <hi>Goa</hi> in his ſtately Monument above three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore years after his Death, as freſh and ruddy as when he was alive, they would not have given Orders to have it cut off; and that if he who obeyed that Command, had read that Letter, he would have anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with as much reſpect as St. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> did, <hi>Nec poſſum, nec audio.</hi> For beſides, that that Arm which is now to be ſeen at <hi>Rome</hi> is all withered, and that ſince that time the holy Body is not ſo freſh as it was before; they who were employed in that Office, and had the boldneſs to lay hands upon that ſacred Body, died within the Year.

               <p>It was agreed upon on both ſides, That the Pope, as Succeſſor of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> was Head of the Church, the Father and Teacher of all Believers, who had received from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>

               <p>From thoſe two Clauſes of the Bull wherein both the Eaſtern and Weſtern Churches, after they had well examined them, agreed, two things may be unqueſtionably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded: the one, that the Pope can determine nothing in his Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of infallible Authority, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:97808:134"/>the Conſent of the Church; and the other, that the Exerciſe of his power which is not infinite and unlimited, ought to be moderated according to the Rules preſcribed to him by the Canons of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, to which all Believers are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. What the Popes have over others, is the Care they ought to take to ſee them obſerved, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by their Authority, but by their Example, which is of greater force and efficacy than their Ordinances; and if they themſelves violate them acting arbitrarily as they pleaſe, without regard to the Canons which ought to be their meaſures, or ſuffer them to be violated by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers without puniſhment, they become culpable before God, who hath made them not the Maſters, but the Stewards of the Church, to act according to her Orders, and cauſe them to be obeyed.

               <p>But ſeeing that Remedy is tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and that it may be abuſed by Appeals very ill brought, which, ſeeing they could not be judged in an whole Age, would render the pontifical Authority uſeleſs in the ſmalleſt matters, which <hi>Pius</hi> II. and <hi>Julius</hi> II. have moſt juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; inſtead thereof, we have

               <p>For in this chiefly conſiſt the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the Kingdom and <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, that no new thing can be commanded or enjoyned us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the holy Decrees of the Councils received in <hi>France,</hi> and againſt the ancient Law, in the poſſeſſion whereof we have always maintained our ſelves, without ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to any other Laws, unleſs we our ſelves conſent to them; ſo that whatever derogates from theſe ancient Conſtitutions which are our inviolable Laws, is by Decree reſcinded.

<pb n="240" facs="tcp:97808:137"/>great Canoniſt, and great Lawyer, who ſpeaks like a Pope, when he ſays,<note place="margin">Quae in derogationem ſanctorum canonum at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentantur, tanto potius infringi volumus, &amp; carere robore firmita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis; quanto authoritas univerſalis Eccleſiae, cui praeſidemus, ad id nos provocat &amp; inducit. <hi>Innoc.

               <p>From all that I have ſaid in this Chapter, this truth of Fact reſults, That all Antiquity hath believed, that Popes being ſubject to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Councils, and obliged to act and govern according to the Laws that are preſcribed to them by the Canons, Councils by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent are above the Popes.</p>

               <p>SEeing that Queſtion was not moved in the Ancient Church, when all were of the Opinion that I have now mentioned: Councils that decide nothing but upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Differences and Diſputes which ariſe amongſt Chriſtians about ſome certain point of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, have given no definitive Sentence as to that particular, till it was begun to be queſtioned and diſputed about.<note place="margin">Concil.

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:97808:138"/>expreſs Promiſe they had made of reſigning up their Pretenſions.</p>

                  </note> wherein he proved by many Reaſons, that the Univerſal Church, and by conſequent a General Council which repreſents her, is above the Pope; adding, that that was the Judgment of the Univerſity of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> and of all the other Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No ſooner was he come down from the Pulpit, but that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Novare</hi> ſtept up, and read aloud a Writing, which declared, that an hundred and three Doctors and Licentiates of Divinity, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted

                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>June.</hi>
                  </note> from which they had Letters, and of that of <hi>Florence,</hi> who had given it in writing under the Hands of ſixſcore Doctors.</p>
               <p>Six days after, the Proceſs that was brought againſt <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Benet</hi> having been proved and made out in a judicial manner, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil paſt a definitive Sentence, whereby it declares, <hi>Pietro de la Luna</hi> and <hi>Angelo Corario</hi> heretofore called Popes, <hi>Benet</hi> XIII. and <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> XII. obſtinate Schiſmaticks and Hereticks, convicted of enormous Crimes, of Perjury, Impiety, and of Colluſion, to deceive Believers, and to keep up the Schiſm which ſo long had rent the Church, and as ſuch, depoſes them from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy.
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:97808:139"/>This the Council did pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant to the Decree, whereby it had before determined, that that Council repreſented the Church univerſal, and that it was the only ſupreme Judge upon Earth to whom the Judgment of that Cauſe belonged, though it was moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that one of theſe two Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders was the true Pope.</p>
               <p>After wards they choſe <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> V. who was acknowledged by the Univerſal Church, except thoſe two wretched Remains of <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> who held out ſtill for the two Antipopes; and that Pope appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all the Decrees of the Council, even a moment before his Death, which was moſt holy and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the ſight of God. I have heretofore proved, according to the Judgment of almoſt all the Churches of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> of that of <hi>Rome</hi> in particular, nay and of the Univerſal Church repreſented by the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> which was but a continuation of this, that it ought to be reckoned, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:97808:139"/>contradiction, lawful. But, ſince on the one hand, it hath pleaſed ſome Doctors beyond the <hi>Alpes</hi> to doubt of it, and that on the other, I decline all diſpute in this Treatiſe, I will only ſtick to matter of Fact, which cannot be conteſted; to wit, that this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Piſa</hi> hath been one of the greateſt Aſſemblies that was ever ſeen in the Church.</p>
               <p>For there were in it five and twenty Cardinals, four Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, ſix and twenty Archbiſhops, an hundred fourſcore and two Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops either in perſon or by <hi>Proxy,</hi> two hundred fourſcore and ten Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots, amongſt whom were all the Heads of the Orders, the Generals of the <hi>Carthuſians</hi> and of the four Mendicant Orders, the great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> of the <hi>Holy Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre</hi> and the Teutonick Knights, the Deputies of the Univerſities of <hi>Paris, Tholouſe, Orleans, Angers, Montpellier, Bologna, Florence, Cracovia, Vienna, Prague, Cologne, Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and of ſome
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:97808:140"/>others, and thoſe of the Chapters of above an hundred Metropolitan and Cathedral Churches, above three hundred Doctors of Divinity and of the Law, the Ambaſſadors of the Kings of <hi>France, England, Poland, Bohemia, Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus,</hi> of the Dukes of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Lorrain, Brabant, Bavaria,</hi> of the Marqueſs of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave of <hi>Thuringe,</hi> and of almoſt all the other Princes of <hi>Germany;</hi> beſides that the Kings of <hi>Hungary, Sweden, Denmark, Norway,</hi> and, in a word, thoſe of <hi>Spain,</hi> except <hi>Arragon,</hi> ſhortly after adhered to that Council; and by conſequent, all theſe Prelates, all theſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, all theſe Orders, all theſe Univerſities, all theſe Kingdoms, all theſe States, that's to ſay, in a word, almoſt all Chriſtians, in the beginning of the fifteenth Century, when that Diſpute was ſtarted concerning the Superiority of the Council or of the Pope, believed, conform to the Belief of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:97808:140"/>That a Council is above the Pope.</p>
               <p>But you are to take notice of ſomewhat more particular and convincing ſtill. When five years after, the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> was opened, for continuing that of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi> as it had been decreed in that Council, which was rather inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted than concluded, the Diſpute concerning the Superiority of the Pope or of the Council, was ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again with greater Heat than before, For ſome Cardinals being arrived from <hi>Scaffhauſen,</hi> whither the Pope who had eſcaped from <hi>Conſtance</hi> had retired, attempted in full Aſſembly where <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> the Emperour was preſent, to prove that the Council was diſſolved, becauſe <hi>John</hi> XXIII. who had aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned it, being owned for true Pope by all that were preſent, was above the Council which could have no Authority without him.</p>
               <p>Then was there a general mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring in the Aſſembly, and many
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:97808:141"/>of thoſe who had greateſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Reputation by reaſon of their Dignity and Knowledge,<note place="margin">Et iis reſponſum fuit alacriter per plures de ipſo concilio viros mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae authoritatis &amp; ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entificos, ſcilicet quod Papa non eſſet ſupra Concilium, ſed ſub con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilio, &amp; facta eſt illie contentio magna hinc inde. <hi>Niem. in vit.

               <p>Wherefore that Queſtion, both before and after the Sermon of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> having been examined in the Conferences of Nations, according to the Order appointed by the Council, a Report of it was made in the fourth Seſſion,<note place="margin">Act.

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:97808:141"/>
                  <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> the Ambaſſadors of the Kings of <hi>France, England, Poland, Norway, Cyprus, Navarr,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Princes of <hi>Germany;</hi> and there, ſeeing it had been already declared in the preceding Seſſion, that the Council ſubſiſted, and ſtill retained all its Force and Authority, tho the Pope had withdrawn himſelf, it was by common Conſent thus concluded and defined; That <hi>the Holy Council lawfully aſſembled, and repreſenting the Church Militant, hath received immediately from Jeſus Chriſt a Power which all and every one, even the Pope himſelf, are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to obey, in all that concerns the Faith, the extirpation of Schiſm, and the general Reformation of the Church of God, in its Head and Members.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to the end that it might not be ſaid what ſome have ſaid ſince without having carefully read the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> that that is only to be underſtood during the time of a Schiſm, it is added to the Decree in the following Seſſion, <hi>That whatever Pope refuſes to obey the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:97808:142"/>Decrees not only of this Council, but alſo of any other that ſhall be lawfully called, ought to be puniſhed if he amend not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Council afterward exerciſes its ſovereign Authority over Pope <hi>John</hi> XXIII. acknowledged by them for true Pope, by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and by all Chriſtian People, except a very few who ſtill adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Schiſmaticks. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> V. who was choſen Pope in place of <hi>John</hi> XXIII. in the forty fifth Seſſion, approved the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees which had ſolemnly been made in that Council, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted that he would obſerve them inviolably. In fine, in the Bull wherein he enjoyns what is to be asked of Hereticks who return from their Hereſie, amongſt others this Article is put: <hi>Whether they believe not that all Believers ought to approve and hold what the holy Council of</hi> Conſtance, <hi>repreſenting the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church, holds and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves for the Integrity of the Faith and the Salvation of Souls; and
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:97808:142"/>whether they condemn not and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute not condemned, what the ſame holy Council hath condemned and condemns as contrary to the Faith and good Manners.</hi> This, without doubt, is one of the moſt authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Approbations that a Pope can give to a Council.</p>
               <p>Now ſeeing, in compliance with a Decree of this Council, the Pope had called another at <hi>Pavia,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward at <hi>Sienna,</hi> and laſtly at <hi>Baſil,</hi> where it was held fourteen Years after that of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Eugenius</hi> IV. who cauſed the Cardinal <hi>Julian</hi> of St. <hi>Angelo,</hi> named by his Predeceſſor for that Function, to preſide in it in his place, that Council in the ſecond Seſſion, when without contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction it was very lawful, the Pope preſiding therein by his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, renewed thoſe two Decrees, and defined the ſame thing in the ſame terms, touching the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of General Councils, to which Popes were obliged to ſubmit, in

               <p>There are two Councils then without ſpeaking of that of <hi>Piſa,</hi> whereof the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> was a continuation, and two Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils in formal terms approved by two Popes, <hi>Martin</hi> V. and <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> IV. and theſe Councils deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, the one during the Schiſm, and the other after the Schiſm was extinct, that every Council re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the Univerſal Church, is ſuperiour to the Pope. Now all the Doctors of that party which hold for the Pope's Superiority, acknowledge that a Council uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal and approved, cannot err in its Deciſions; whence it may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be concluded, that ſince the Decrees of theſe Councils, one is obliged to believe what all Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity before theſe Councils belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that is, that an Oecumenical Council lawfully aſſembled, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Pope. I don't ſee how one can avoid this, without find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ways to invalidate the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Councils, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:97808:144"/>of that of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> which is held for the ſixteenth General Council.

               <p>THree years ſince,<note place="margin">Ann. <hi>1682.</hi> Cleri Gallicani de Eccleſiaſticâ poteſtate declaratio.</note> the Clergy of <hi>France</hi> repreſenting the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, being by Order of the King aſſembled at <hi>Paris,</hi> made an authentick Declaration in four Articles, of what they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and define concerning Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Power, conform to the Holy Scriptures, Tradition, and the practice of the whole Church, and particularly of that of <hi>France.</hi> Amongſt other things, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare in the ſecond Article, <hi>That the Popes, Succeſſors of St.</hi> Peter, <hi>have in ſuch manner full power over the ſpiritual, That the Decrees of the holy Council of</hi> Conſtance, <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the Holy Apoſtolick See, and contained in the fourth and fifth Seſſion, concerning the Authority
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:97808:145"/>of General Councils, muſt alſo remain in their full force, and not at all be infringed.</hi> And they add, <hi>That the</hi> Gallican <hi>Church approves not the Opinion of thoſe who would weaken theſe Decrees, and rob them of all their force, ſaying that their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may be called in queſtion; that they are not ſufficiently approved, or that they extend not beyond the time when there is a Schiſm in the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doubtleſs there is nothing more authoritative, (and at the ſame time more modeſt) than that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of a Church ſo venerable in all Ages as the <hi>Gallican</hi> hath been, and which, next to that of the Apoſtles, hath always main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and made the Catholick Faith to flouriſh in <hi>France</hi> in its full Integrity, without having been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuſpected of the leaſt Error. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, there is a late Writer, to wit, the <hi>Sieur Emmanuel Schelſtrate,</hi> Canon of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and Under-Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary-keeper of the <hi>Vatican,</hi> who, as he declares at firſt in the Scheme
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:97808:146"/>of his Diſſertation, undertakes to overthrow all that the Clergy of <hi>France</hi> hath aſſerted concerning theſe Decrees, and to ſhew in three Chapters; firſt, that one may and ought rationally to doubt of their Authority; ſecondly, that it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be underſtood during the time of a Schiſm, and in regard of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted Popes; and laſtly, that they are ſo far from being appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that they have been manifeſtly rejected by an expreſs Bull.</p>
               <p>Now ſeeing the authentick Acts which we have of the Councils of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> are in the hands of every Body, and owned for true for above two hundred and three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Years, and no man ever dream'd to call them into queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: he hath bethought himſelf of diſputing us that lawful and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able poſſeſſion, authoriſed by the long Preſcription of almoſt three hundred Years. And this he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to do, by oppoſing to us cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain old Manuſcripts that he hath
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:97808:146"/>raiſed out of the Grave, which contain the Regiſter and Acts of the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> which had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been ſeen, as they are there, and which God, by a ſingular Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as he ſaith, hath ſuffered to be found almoſt at the ſame time when the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church made her Declaration; as if he would afford means of confounding it at the very Inſtant that it was publiſhed.</p>
               <p>This, without doubt, is an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking magnificently projected. But what is it founded upon? Upon the moſt ruinous Foundation in the World, and which I might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily overturn, and by conſequent all the Superſtructure, by ſaying in one word, which is moſt true, that the pretended good Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts that he produceth againſt us, after a Poſſeſſion of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred threeſcore and ten Years, are not more to be received, and are not near ſo good, as thoſe from which the Decrees that we have of the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> have been
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:97808:147"/>taken. Should I anſwer him in this manner, it would lie at his door to prove that his Manuſcripts are better than ours, which he will never be able to do, as we ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſee. But to do him a favour, I am content not to handle them according to Rigour, only will clearly and calmly make it out to him, with all the reſpect that is due to his Character, that the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences which he draws from what he finds there are falſe; and that after his way of arguing, all Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical Councils might be ſtrip'd of the Authority which they ought to have, and which they have had in the Church to this preſent.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXIII.</hi> A Refutation of the firſt Chapter of the Diſſertation of <hi>M. Schelſtrate.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THIS Author undertakes to prove in this Chapter againſt the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, That the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the fourth and fifth Seſſion of the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> are of dubious Authority; firſt, becauſe the Decree of the fourth Seſſion hath been corrupted by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Council of <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſil,</hi> who in the Extract that they cauſed to be made in the Year 1442. of the Decrees of the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> omitted in the firſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree the words <hi>ad fidem,</hi> and added thereunto theſe words; <hi>Et ad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formationem generalem Eccleſiae Dei in capite &amp; in membris: That all men, even the Pope, are obliged to obey that Council, in what concerns the Reformation of the Church in its Head and Members.</hi> As to the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:97808:148"/>Omiſſion of the word <hi>ad fidem,</hi> he is ſo favourable as to excuſe it, for it appears only to have been done by the fault of the Tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, becauſe that word is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be found every where, and indeed ought to be there. As to the words which he pretends have been added, he confeſſes that they are in all the Editions of the Councils that have been hitherto made; becauſe, as he ſays, they have all followed the firſt that was made in the Year One thouſand four hundred fourſcore and nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, at <hi>Haguenau,</hi> from a Copy of that Extract of the Fathers of <hi>Baſil:</hi> but he pretends that it is not lawful, and that thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have added theſe Words; upon no other proof, but that they are not to be found in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Manuſcripts which he hath ſeen.</p>
               <p>Well, muſt it be allowed then upon a proof of this Nature, and a bare negative Argument which
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:97808:148"/>does not conclude, to accuſe a whole Aſſembly of Prelates of an Impoſture, in which a Cardinal preſided, a man of a very auſtere Virtue, whom Pope <hi>Clement</hi> VII. hath canonized? Let him be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of Head-ſtrongneſs, and of abounding in his own Senſe, in what he thought to be juſt; I conſent to that, there was his weak ſide: but that he ſhould be taken for an Impoſtor and a Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and be treated ſo, upon ſo bare a conjecture, is a thing that honeſt men can hardly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</p>
               <p>The Manuſcripts which <hi>M. Schel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate</hi> hath ſeen contain not theſe laſt Words of the Decree: be it ſo, we take it upon his Word, reckon him an honeſt man, and ſhall never accuſe him of having impoſed upon us, but only of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving reaſoned ill, in concluding from thence, that the Fathers of <hi>Baſil</hi> have falſified that Decree: for who hath told him that the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:97808:149"/>Manuſcript from which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of <hi>Baſil</hi> made their Extract, contained not theſe words? Why does he, without being well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of it, accuſe them of Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture? Don't we daily ſee, that there is difference amongſt ſeveral manuſcript Copies of one and the ſame work, that there is to be found in one what hath been omitted in another, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ancient Editions are correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Witneſs that true and famous Hiſtory of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> which the Fathers of <hi>Saint German des Prez</hi> cauſe to be made from a great many Manuſcripts, the differences whereof they mark, and from ſome of which they take what they add to the ancient Editions which want certain words that are not to be found in the Copies from which they have been printed. Ought he not to preſume that that Copy of <hi>Baſil</hi> hath been taken from a Manuſcript that had theſe laſt Words, which he hath not found
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:97808:149"/>in his own, that ought to be reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned defective?</p>
               <p>And to prove to him that they are ſo, I declare, that thoſe which I have ſeen, and which are very ancient, have the ſame Words at the end of the Decree of the fourth Seſſion. And at the very Inſtant that I am writing this in my Apartment in the Monaſtery of St. <hi>Victor</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> where the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons regular of that Royal Abbey have done me the favour to let me chuſe an honourable Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſuitable to my Profeſſion and way of Living. I have before me that famous Manuſcript of their celebrated Library, from which <hi>Monſieur de Sponde</hi> hath taken all that is moſt rare in his Hiſtory of the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> which is certainly the fineſt part of his work. Now in this Manuſcript which is the moſt ancieat that can be ſeen, I read that Decree word for word as it ſtands in the printed Acts, and in the laſt Editions, the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:97808:150"/>moſt exact and moſt correct of all.</p>
               <p>But there's one thing ſtill more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable. We have in theſe Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts of St. <hi>Victor,</hi> the Extract of the Seſſions which they who were at the Council for the <hi>French</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſent to <hi>Paris,</hi> as faſt as they got them; and that Decree of the fourth Seſſion is to be found there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in in expreſs terms as we have it. Will <hi>M. Schelſtrate</hi> ſay, that the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> which was not held till many Years after the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> hath falſified theſe Extracts? What can he anſwer to that?</p>
               <p>And, that he may not think to object to us the multitude of his Manuſcripts, for he quotes nine of them, I can tell him that there are ten in <hi>Paris,</hi> all conform to that of St. <hi>Victor,</hi> which alone is worth all his. And certainly I can very well exceed that number, ſeeing I my ſelf, not to ſpeak of ot her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcripts which they who are more
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:97808:150"/>curious than I am, without doubt, have in their Libraries, have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered ten of them.</p>
               <p>Beſides, we may produce againſt him the unqueſtionable Evidences of <hi>Peter D' Ailly</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray,</hi> and of the famous <hi>John Gerſon</hi> Chancellor of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> who was at the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> not only as the Deputy of that great Body, but alſo as Ambaſſadour from the King: for, in fine, that holy and learned man, who cannot be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of Impoſture, and whoſe Manuſcripts we have, in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces relates that firſt Decree of the fourth Seſſion, word for word, as it is in the Manuſcript of St. <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,</hi>

                  <hi>I am of Opinion, that in all Churches, and in the moſt eminent Places of the World, this holy and moſt uſeful Definition, this Law or Rule of the Council, ought to be written, or even engraved, in great Letters, as being the fundamental and infallible Direction which we ought to follow againſt the horrible and monſtrous Scandal, which is a ſtumbling Block that many amongſt us have caſt in the way of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, determining, and endeavouring to prove by Texts of the Gloſs ill underſtood, contrary to the Evangelical and Eternal Rule, that the Pope is not ſubject to a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:97808:151"/>Council, and that he cannot be judged by it; beſides, that a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council receives from him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately all its force, and that in no caſe it can be called and held without him; that no man may ſay to him,</hi> Why do you do that? <hi>becauſe he is not bound to obey the Laws, and that he is above all Canons: and many other ſuch Maxims, whereby a ſoft, fallacious, and malicious flattery fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the unbridled deſire of predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating, and changed the Pontifical Power, or the exerciſe of it, into a Tyranny which wholly ruined the Church; ſo that there would no way remain of reducing matters into good Order, and of ſetling Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I would beſeech <hi>M. Schel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate</hi> to tell me ingenuouſly, if he dares think that the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of <hi>Paris</hi> had the Impudence to recite in a Sermon, and before all the Fathers of the Council, the Decree of the fourth Seſſion, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than they themſelves had made it; and add impudently theſe
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:97808:152"/>words, <hi>Ad reformationem Eccleſiae in Capite &amp; in membris,</hi> which the Council had not put into it; and afterwards to ſpeak to them in the manner I have now mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I take him to be a man of too much Honour, and too pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, ever to let that Thought en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into his Head; and I make no doubt but that he will give Glory to God by confeſſing, That ſince <hi>Gerſon</hi> recited that Decree before the whole Council as we have it in the printed Acts, it is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evident that the Council made it ſo, and that it is not in the leaſt falſified; that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Council would have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him the Lie as an impudent Impoſtor.</p>
               <p>But what now if I ſhew that that ſo famous Doctor hath done the ſame oftner than once, as may be ſeen particularly in the Sermon which he made before all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Council, the ſecond Sunday after the <hi>Epiphany,</hi> upon
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:97808:152"/>that Text of the Goſpel, <hi>There was a Marriage in</hi> Cana <hi>of</hi> Galilee? There he treats very amply of the Marriage of Jeſus Chriſt with his Church, repreſented by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Conſtance;</hi> and having ſaid that the ſecond Advantage of that Spouſe, is the fullneſs of Power that the Council which repreſents her hath even over the Pope, and that that was ſolidly proved in a Book lately before publiſhed; he ſpeaks in this manner.</p>

                  <hi>and without doubt they are in the right, becauſe ſaying ſo, they compare the Pope with all Believers and all Churches taken particularly.

               <p>All theſe Manuſcripts have been communicated to me by <hi>Monſieur d' Herouval,</hi> Regular Canon of St. <hi>Victor,</hi> and Doctor of the <hi>Surhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> whoſe merit already well known to the Learned, will ſhortly be to the Publick, in the new Edition that he is preparing of the Works of <hi>Gerſon,</hi> which by his Care and Pains, will be found reſtored to their Perfection, that they have never hitherto had.</p>

Cardinal <hi>Julian,</hi> who was nominated by <hi>Martin</hi> V. to preſide in that Council, and who after the Death of that Pope preſided therein in Name of <hi>Eugenius</hi> IV. conſented to that Decree in behalf of the Pope in that ſecond Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and defended it in the Letter which he wrote to <hi>Eugenius,</hi> to remonſtrate to him the Reaſons which obliged his Holineſs not to offer to diſſolve that Council.

               </p>
               <p>Would he have more ſtill? Here is enough to ſatisfie him. <hi>Eugenius</hi> IV. in the Bull which he publiſhed during the ſixteenth Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, declares, That, according to the Decrees of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> he had called the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> for the Extirpation of Hereſies, the Peace of Chriſtian People, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Reformation of the Church <hi>in Capite &amp; in Membris:</hi> and ſeeing the Council was lawfully aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,<note place="margin">Qui nimo praefatam diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutionem irritam, &amp; inanem declarantes, ipſum ſacrum Conciti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um purè, ſimpliciter &amp; cum effectu, ac omni devotione &amp; favore proſequimur, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequi intendimus.</note> it hath ſtill continued, and ſo ought to be continued, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing thoſe three ends, as if it had never been diſſolved. Then he reſcinds all that he had done for the diſſolution of it, proteſting that he approves it, and will have it to continue purely, ſimply, and with
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:97808:156"/>all Devotion and Favour. Thus the Pope ſpeaks, who when he was Cardinal was preſent at the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> whoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees he could not be ignorant of; and by conſequent, if the Decree of the ſecond Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in the ſame Council, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> had not been the ſame in proper terms, it is not to be doubted but that <hi>Eugenius</hi> would have affirmed it to be falſe, and have rejected it.</p>
               <p>In fine, in the very ſame Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript which <hi>M. Schelſtrate</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces, there is to be found in the Preface of the Decree, as in our Acts, that, <hi>This Holy Council of</hi> Conſtance <hi>lawfully aſſembled for the Extirpation of the preſent Schiſm, for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, and for the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that ought to be made of the Church in its Head and Members, to the end that that Union and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Church may the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily, more ſurely, more amply, and
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:97808:157"/>more freely be obtained, ordains, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, and defines as follows; to wit, That all men, of whatſoever Dignity they be, even Papal, are obliged to obey the Council in all things belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Faith, and the Extirpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Schiſm.</hi> And who does not ſee that for compleating the Senſe according to the Intention and expreſs words of the Council, one muſt not ſtop there, but that it muſt neceſſarily follow, <hi>and to the Reformation of the Church in the Head and Members thereof?</hi> So it is in our Copies which are true, and is wanting in his, which unjuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable Omiſſion makes them clearly appear to be defective.</p>
               <p>But, ſays <hi>M. Schelſtrate,</hi> one of my Manuſcripts affirms, that the day before, and the very ſame day of the fourth Seſſion, there were great Debates concerning the matters to be put into the Decree, and that at length by a ſudden In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, all agreed, that nothing ſhould be
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:97808:157"/>put into it but the Points that are to be ſeen in that Copy; and the other Manuſcript informs me, that the Emperour made them all agree by finding a moderation to which he brought the Cardinals to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Now that is exactly what we would be at: I'll tell ye how. There were four Points to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined relating to that Decree: firſt, Whether the Council hath received immediately from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> a full Power to which the Pope himſelf is obliged to ſubmit in what concerns the Faith and the Extirpation of Schiſm; ſecondly, and if it ought to be put into it, <hi>in what concerns the Reformation of the Church, in the Head and Members;</hi> thirdly, whether in caſe the Pope would not obey it, he might be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; and fourthly, if all that ought to be underſtood of any other Council as well as of that of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the firſt, ſince all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions agreed upon it, it eaſily paſt;
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:97808:158"/>but as to the three others, ſome, and eſpecially the Cardinals, who, at leaſt, would therein gratifie the Pope, oppoſed them. Now the mean and moderation which the Emperour <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> found out to unite all diſſenting minds, was, that in the Decree of the preſent fourth Seſſion, the two firſt Points only ſhould be inſerted, and that for the other two they might after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards conſider what was to be done about them in the following Senſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. That appears manifeſtly by our Acts, by our Manuſcripts, and even by that of <hi>M. Schelſtrate,</hi> wherein, as I have juſt now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, there is a neceſſity, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Proceeding, for making a rational and compleat Senſe, that theſe Words which have been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in it, be added, <hi>And as to what concerns the Reformation of the Church in the Head and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is more clearly ſtill to be ſeen in the fifth Seſſion which was
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:97808:158"/>held eight days after, and wherein for putting an end wholly to that Affair, and for propoſing without Interruption, and at one glance, what men ought to believe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that Point, they put in the firſt place the Decree of the fourth Seſſion word for word as we have it; and then made a Decree, by which the two other Points were defined and declared, to wit, that the Pope himſelf is obliged to obey not only that Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> that was held during the Schiſm, but alſo all others; and that if he refuſe to ſubmit to them he may be puniſhed. And this is to be ſeen not only in our Acts and Copies, but likewiſe in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript of <hi>M. Schelſtrate,</hi> as he himſelf confeſſes; and therefore he muſt acknowledge, that even though theſe Words, <hi>for the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Church in the Head and Members,</hi> had not been put into the Decree of the fourth Seſſion, as he pretends, yet that would not at
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:97808:159"/>all reach the bottom of the Affair, becauſe they are actually in the Decree of the fifth Seſſion. For to render a Decree authentick, what matters it in what Seſſion it hath been made?</p>
               <p>After all, it muſt neceſſarily be concluded from what I have now ſaid as to theſe uncontroverted matters of Fact, that we ought not to correct the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> according to the Manuſcripts of <hi>M. Schelſtrate.</hi> But on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it is his part to correct them according to ours, and according to the Council, as we have it. And ſo, the firſt Argument that he alledges why we ſhould doubt of the Authority of theſe Decrees, is null.</p>
               <p>The other two are of the ſame force, and in a few words, may without any difficulty be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown. Seeing he cannot deny but that theſe two Decrees are in the fifth Seſſion, he ſaith what he hath learned from thoſe <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltramontanian</hi>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:97808:159"/>
                  <hi>Authors</hi> who have written for the Superiority of the Pope againſt that Council; to wit, that they were made in a hurry, without ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Deliberation, and againſt the Judgment of many who oppoſed them. This is the very ſame thing that the <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> nay and ſome of our Proteſtants, have ſaid againſt the Council of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and againſt St. <hi>Cyril,</hi> whom they accuſe of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cauſed <hi>Neſtorius</hi> to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned with extream Precipitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without hearing him, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out poſſibility of having the cauſe ſufficiently examined. All Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks might ſay as much, and do, indeed ſay ſo of all Councils which have condemned their Hereſie.</p>
               <p>But, not to reſt on that, I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to <hi>M. Schelſtrate,</hi> that there never was a Queſtion better exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, than that which was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in this Council. For, ſince the Council of <hi>Piſa,</hi> where it was firſt ſtarted, had decided in favour of the Council, it was almoſt the
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:97808:160"/>whole Subject of Diſputes and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, and was toſſed to and fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> even before and after the Sermon of <hi>John Gerſon.</hi> Beſides, after that Aſſembly wherein all that the Cardinals who were ſent from the Pope objected, had been convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly refuted, it was ſo well exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, that all the four Nations ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſced in the Point.</p>
               <p>I know very well, there were great Debates about it, and that the Cardinals oppoſed it; I even grant him what he hath found in his Manuſcript, and which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes had never been known be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and which, perhaps, is not true, that the Cardinals, nay and the Ambaſſadours of <hi>France,</hi> made a private Proteſtation in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Preſence, that it was only for avoiding of Scandal that they aſſiſted at the fifth Seſſion, and not for conſenting to what they knew was to be defined in it. What can he conclude from thence? Hath
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:97808:160"/>not he read the Hiſtory of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claves,</hi> where, after a thouſand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues, a thouſand Oppoſitions, and a thouſand other things more than I can tell, at length a lawful Election is made, to which all the Cardinals who were ſo divided before, conſent? Let him read the Hiſtories of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> written by <hi>Fra. Paolo</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Pallavicini,</hi> there he will find a great many Debates about Points that were to be decided in the Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and nevertheleſs the Holy Ghoſt, which unites all minds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one Judgment, made all the Decrees of that Council to paſs with the unanimous Conſent of all the Fathers who had been ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided before.</p>
               <p>It is juſt ſo with this Council of <hi>Conſtance;</hi> I grant there may have been Oppoſitions, Conteſts, private Proteſtations, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>M. Schelſtrate</hi> pleaſes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us of from his Manuſcripts: yet when all is done, theſe Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:97808:161"/>and all they who debated and proteſted privately, were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the fifth Seſſion: and ſeeing the Holy Ghoſt unites all minds in a Council, to the end they may ſay, <hi>Viſum eſt ſpiritui ſancto &amp; nobis,</hi> the two Decrees of that Seſſion paſt by common Conſent, as the Acts ſay, to which <hi>M. Schelſtrate</hi> has nothing at all in his Manuſcripts that can be objected.<note place="margin">Quibus articulis ſive constitutionibus lectis, concilium cos &amp; cas uniformiter approbavit &amp; concluſit.</note> This is the Language of the Acts: <hi>Theſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and Decrees having been read, the Council with a common Conſent appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In fine, the third Argument he makes uſe of to weaken the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Decrees of theſe two Seſſions, is, that the Council be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then only made up of thoſe of the <hi>Obedience</hi> of <hi>John</hi> XXIII. could not repreſent the Univerſal Church. Now, to convince him of the Inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificancy of that Argument, which without doubt is the weakeſt of all, I need only tell him in two words, that what he ſuppoſes after
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:97808:161"/>
                  <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who hath ſupplied him with all his weak Objections, is very falſe. For almoſt all the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals of the two <hi>Obediences</hi> of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> XII. and <hi>Benet</hi> XIII. were uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Council of <hi>Piſa,</hi> where theſe two pretended Popes, who by Colluſion played upon all <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> were declared Schiſmaticks and Antipopes, and <hi>Alexander</hi> V. choſen, who was acknowledged for true Pope by moſt Churches, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Competition, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the ſame Cardinals and Biſhops who conſtituted that nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Council, continued it at <hi>Conſtance,</hi> as Pope <hi>John</hi> XXIII own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſame Council for true Pope, declares in expreſs terms in the Bull whereby he calls that Council, according as it had been decreed at <hi>Piſa</hi> five Years before. So that the <hi>Obedience</hi> of <hi>John</hi> XXIII. beſides the Concurrence of almoſt all the Kingdoms of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> nay and of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:97808:162"/>was over and above compoſed of the greater and ſounder part of the two other who were re-united at <hi>Piſa,</hi> and continued that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at <hi>Conſtance.</hi> If <hi>M. Schelſtrate</hi> pretend that the Abſence of thoſe who held for the one or other of thoſe two who had been declared Schiſmaticks and Antipopes, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Council from being Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical, he muſt know that his unjuſt Pretence would ruine moſt of the Oecumenical Councils; for the Hereticks that have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in them might ſay, that thoſe of their Party who had right to be preſent in them, either were not there, or would not own them for lawful and Oecumenical Councils.</p>
               <p>And Proteſtants might ſay the ſame, eſpecially of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> where neither the Biſhops of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor of <hi>Denmark, Norway, Sweden,</hi> and that part of <hi>Germany</hi> who follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Confeſſion of <hi>Ausbourg,</hi> nor
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:97808:162"/>the Biſhops of <hi>Greece,</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who own not the Pope for Head of the Church, and who are no more of his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, than thoſe at the time of the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> who held for <hi>Pietro de la Luna</hi> or <hi>Angelo Corario,</hi> were preſent. All theſe Biſhops, I ſay, of ſo great a part of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World, were abſent from the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> when it made its Decrees, and would not own it. Is there any thing more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain? And nevertheleſs <hi>M. Schel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate</hi> is obliged to confeſs with all other Catholicks, that their Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence could not hinder that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil from being Oecumenical, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe for making it univerſal, it is enough that all be invited to it, as they were, and that they might be preſent there if they pleaſed, or if the Princes on whom they depend gave them leave. So that the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Prelates who were the Dregs of thoſe two Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, hinders not but that the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:97808:163"/>Decrees of <hi>Conſtance</hi> are the Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions of an Univerſal Council, and that they have an infallible Authority.</p>
               <p>But there is ſtill ſomewhat that preſſes more home: for if it were not ſo, and if it were to be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſays before <hi>M. Schelſtrate,</hi> that theſe Decrees have no Authority, by reaſon of that Abſence, and that there was no Pope in Council when they were made, ſtrange things would follow from thence. In the firſt place, the Condemnation of the Errors of <hi>Wicleff</hi> and <hi>John Huſs</hi> would be null, becauſe they were condemned in the <hi>fifteenth</hi> Seſſion,<note place="margin">Seſſ. 15.</note> before the Union of the remnant of thoſe two <hi>Obediences,</hi> and when as yet there was no Pope there in the Council. Secondly, that deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Propoſition of <hi>John Petit,</hi> that any private man might meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly kill a Tyrant, any way what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, would not be lawfully condemned of Hereſie by the ſame
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:97808:163"/>reaſon. And laſtly, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and afterwards the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of <hi>John</hi> XXIII.<note place="margin">Seſſ. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>I am ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged,</hi> ſaid he to him, <hi>moſt holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to remonſtrate to your Holineſs, that if the Decrees of</hi> Conſtance, <hi>which the Council of</hi> Baſil <hi>has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, have no Authority, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> John XXIII. <hi>was depoſed, is of no force. If it be ſo, the Election of Pope</hi> Martin V. <hi>which was made du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Life of</hi> John XXIII. <hi>is null, and conſequently that of your Holineſs,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:97808:164"/>ſeeing you muſt then have been elected by Cardinals of his Creation who was not Pope.</hi> By the ſame reaſon it is evident, that all the other Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions made ſince <hi>Martin</hi> V. until the preſent Pope, muſt be unlawful.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. Schelſtrate,</hi> without doubt, will anſwer to that, that <hi>John</hi> XXIII. conſented to his Condemnation, and even ratified it when he was at liberty. But he muſt needs have done ſo, conſidering the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he was in; and it is enough to read the very Author who is cited, that is <hi>Leonard Aretin,</hi> to be informed that the poor depoſed Pope went to <hi>Florence</hi> to caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at the feet of <hi>Martin</hi> V. only becauſe he knew not whither to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take himſelf,<note place="margin">Conſilio Martini cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nito (id erat ut Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s Anſwer has as little force: <hi>Though,</hi> ſaith he,<note place="margin">Etſi Concilium ſine Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa non poteſt definire nova dogmata fidei, poteſt tamen judicare, tempore Schiſmatis, quis ſit verus Papa, <hi>&amp;c.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil without the Pope cannot determine new Doctrines of Faith, yet it may judge during a Schiſm, who is the true Pope, and provide a true Paſtor for the Church, when there is none cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi> In the firſt place he grants by that, that all which the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil determined againſt <hi>Wicleff, John Huſs,</hi> and <hi>Jerome of Prague,</hi> and againſt that damnable Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of <hi>John Petit,</hi> is null, as having been decided by an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judge: Who dare maintain ſuch a thing? Secondly, it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely falſe that a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, without the Pope, cannot make Decrees concerning the Faith. Did not the firſt Council of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> make ſuch againſt <hi>Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> concerning the Divinity of the Holy Ghoſt? And did not the fifth condemn the Hereſie of the three Chapters, not only without Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> but likewiſe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his Conſtitution, who would
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:97808:165"/>have had them not to be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Beſides, it was not the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that Council to judge who was the true Pope: for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Conſtance</hi> never queſtioned but that <hi>John</hi> XXIII. was, it would only have had him perform the Promiſe which he made to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his Right, and freely to lay down, for Peace ſake, tho he was true Pope. And in the fourth place, if that Council was not then, as he called it before, but a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Council where a third part of the Church only met, it could not lawfully have condemned <hi>John</hi> XXIII; becauſe, as all agree, none but an Oecumenical Council, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting an Univerſal Church, hath that Power and ſupreme Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; nay, and many deny that it can, unleſs in caſe of Hereſie, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed againſt any Pope, much leſs if that Council held him for a true Pope, as the Council of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> owned <hi>John</hi> XXIII, to have been.</p>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:97808:165"/>
               <p>From all this it follows, that the three Reaſons alledged by <hi>M.

                  <hi>CHAP. XXIV.</hi> A Refutation of one of the two Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>M. Schelſtrate.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THis Writer, in one of theſe Chapters, pretends to prove, that thoſe Decrees of the fourth and fifth Seſſion are not approved. I have already made it out, that <hi>Martin</hi> V. approved them twice ſolemnly; once, by ordaining that thoſe who return from Hereſie ſhould be interrogated, whether
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:97808:166"/>or not they approved, without Exception, all which that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil approves, and condemned all that it condemns; and another time in the laſt Seſſion, where he declares, that he approves, and will inviolably obſerve, all the Decrees that have been made in that Council concerning matters of Faith, and as he expreſſes it by a new word, <hi>Conciliariter.</hi> Upon which, two Objections are raiſed againſt us.</p>
               <p>The firſt, from theſe Words, <hi>concerning matters of Faith:</hi> from which <hi>M. Schelſtrate</hi> concludes, that the Pope hath only approved the Decrees againſt <hi>Wickleff,</hi> and <hi>John Huſs, becauſe they alone,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>concern matters of Faith.</hi> What then will become of the other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees that were made for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of Schiſm, and for the Reformation of the Church, which are the two principal Points for which the Council and the Popes <hi>Martin</hi> and <hi>Eugenius,</hi> in expreſs terms, declare that the Holy Synod,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:97808:166"/>repreſenting the Univerſal Church, was called?</p>
               <p>Let him tell me, whether thoſe Decrees be approved or not: if they be not, he muſt then, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Principles, grant that the Depoſition of <hi>John</hi> XXIII. is null, that all that followed upon it is invalid, and that all the good Laws that were made in that Council for Reformation, are of no Authority, and oblige no Man. And if they be approved, it is not to be doubted but that thoſe of the fourth and fifth Seſſion are alſo approved, ſeeing they were chiefly made for the extinction of Schiſm. For if the Council were not above the Pope, even lawfully elected, as <hi>John Gerſon</hi> ſaith, and if it had not Power to depoſe him, when that is neceſſary for the common Good of the Church, in caſe of Hereſie, Schiſm, or enormous Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, as it hath happened oftner than once; the Council could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have compelled the Pope, who was acknowledged to be true and
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:97808:167"/>lawful, to renounce his Right for peace ſake.</p>
               <p>The other Objection brought againſt us is weaker ſtill than the former. Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> whom <hi>M. Schelſtrate</hi> hath followed ſtep for ſtep, upon that word <hi>Concilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riter;</hi> from which he concludes, that theſe Decrees of <hi>Conſtance</hi> have not been approved by Pope <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> V. becauſe the Pope declares,<note place="margin">Id eſt move aliorum Conciliorum, re dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genter examinata. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtat autem hoc decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ſine ullo examine factum à Concilio <hi>Conſtantienſi. L. 2. de Concil c. 19.</hi>
                  </note> that he only approves thoſe which have been made <hi>Conciliariter,</hi> or, as that Cardinal interprets it, in the manner as other Councils have made their Decrees, the Matter having been diligently examined. Now it is ſure, adds he, with the greateſt Confidence imaginable, and as if no body could doubt of the truth of what he ſays, without ſo much as bringing any proof for it, the thing being clear in it ſelf: It is then, ſays he, moſt certain, that that Decree of the Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Council was made by the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> without any Examination, <hi>ſine ullo examine.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="301" facs="tcp:97808:167"/>
               <p>I have two things to ſay to that; firſt, that a manifeſt Falſhood was never aſſerted with ſo much Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: for never was there a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion examined nor debated in the Council with greater heat than this, as I have already made it appear, and as it even appears by the Manuſcript of <hi>M. Schelſtrate.</hi> For there it is to be ſeen, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fourth Seſſion, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties of the Nations, and the Cardinals, after many Conteſts and Oppoſitions of the ſame Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, all agreed,<note place="margin">Habita fuit non modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca diſceptatio inter D. Regem D. D. Cardina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les &amp; deputatos nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onum, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> by a ſudden Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, in one Judgment concerning that Point of the Superiority of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil over the Pope, who ought to obey it in what relates to Faith and the Extirpation of Schiſm. And he adds, that before the fifth Seſſion,<note place="margin">Die Sabbati <hi>6</hi> Aprilis, cum per prius inter D. D. Cardinales &amp; Nations altercatum fuiſſet—tandem or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinatum &amp; concluſum eſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> which was not held till eight days after, and wherein, according to himſelf, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, that the Pope ought to obey the Council in what concerns the Reformation of the Church in the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:97808:168"/>Head and Members, there fell out again great Debates betwixt the Cardinals and the Deputies of the Nations. How can it then be ſaid ſo boldly, without bogling, as Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath done, <hi>Nullo facto examine?</hi> I declare that it is a thing I cannot comprehend, after the unqueſtionable Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that I have before alledged to the contrary.</p>
               <p>The next thing that I have to ſay againſt the Anſwer of <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> is, that that word <hi>Concilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riter</hi> ſignifies not only, as he hath interpreted it, the matter in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion having been well examined, but alſo being afterwards ſolemnly decided in a Seſſion of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, without which nothing is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined. In the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> Votes went by Nations. There were at firſt four, the <hi>Italian, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, French,</hi> and <hi>German,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> was added. The Deputies of every Nation conſulted firſt ſeverally; and then all the Nations communicated their
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:97808:168"/>Opinions: after which, all theſe Nations held an Aſſembly, where every private Perſon had liberty to ſpeak and give his Voice, yet all the Voices made but one Suffrage for each Nation, though they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the number of Prelates and Doctors.</p>
               <p>In fine, when they were all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, after much diſputing and debate, that was no more but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liminary, and a neceſſary Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to a final Deciſion, which was only made in a General Aſſembly of Cardinals, Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Generals of Orders, Ambaſſadors of Princes, and, in a word, of the whole Council, with great Ceremony, after high Maſs, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanies, and other Prayers, in the publick Seſſion held in the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral Church, where after that a Cardinal or Biſhop having from the Pulpit read the Decrees and Articles framed in the Aſſembly of the Nations, demanded if they approved them: it was ſtill free to every one to ſay what he
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:97808:169"/>pleaſed concerning them. And when they had all unanimouſly ſaid <hi>Placet, We conſent to them,</hi> as they never failed to do after theſe previous Deliberations, ſhorter or longer, according to the greater or leſs difficulty of the matters that they had examined; then was the Decree authentically made, and had its full force: and that, in the terms of <hi>Martin</hi> V. is called a Decree made <hi>Concilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this manner the Errors of <hi>Wickleff</hi> were condemned in the eighth Seſſion; that of <hi>John Huſs,</hi> and the damnable Propoſition of <hi>John Petit,</hi> in the fifteenth; defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive Sentence pronounced againſt <hi>John</hi> XXIII. who was depoſed in the twelfth; and the Decrees of the Superiority of the Council made in the fourth and fifth Seſſion. Before that, the Council had determined nothing at all, nor laid any Obligation upon Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
               <pb n="305" facs="tcp:97808:169"/>
               <p>This the Pope, like a very know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man, expreſſes in the terms he makes uſe of, approving the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, in the five and fortieth Seſſion. The Colledge of Cardinals and of the Nations, concluded, that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Book of <hi>F. John Falkenberg,</hi> full of Hereſies, ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. The Ambaſſadors of the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and of the great Duke of <hi>Lithuania,</hi> who concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves in that Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, publickly beſought the Pope to condemn it in full Seſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the concluſion of the Council, according to the Reſolution taken by the Cardinals and the Nations; and they preſſed him to it in ſo offenſive a manner, that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted in name of thoſe Princes their Maſters, that in caſe of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal, they appealed to the next Council.</p>
               <p>Seeing theſe Ambaſſadors had ſpoken ſo haughtily, and in ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliging a manner, under the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Pretext of an extraordinary
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:97808:170"/>Zeal for the Faith; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it was not at all to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that the Pope, in the preſent Juncture, ſhould give cauſe to think, that he thought himſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to ſubmit to what the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals and Nations had determined in their Aſſemblies: he weighed his Words, and anſwered very prudently, making it by his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer appear, that on the one hand he was not wanting to comply with his Obligations; and on the other, that he knew very well how to preſerve his Rights and Liberty.</p>
               <p>For he told them, that he would always inviolably obſerve and ſtick to what the Council had decided in matter of Faith, <hi>Conciliariter.</hi> That ſhews that he had at leaſt as much Zeal for the Faith as theſe Ambaſſadors had, who preſſed him in ſo diſreſpectful a manner to condemn a Book. And at the ſame time he adds, that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves all the Decrees which the Council had made authentically,

This, I think, may undeceive <hi>M.

               <p>And therefore, when one of the Ambaſſadors of the King of <hi>Poland</hi> would ſtill appeal to the next Council, the Pope commanded him Silence upon pain of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication:
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:97808:171"/>and he did very well, becauſe that Appeal was manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raſh, abuſive, and unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it being moſt evident, that a bare Reſolution of the Cardinals and Nations, without the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Council, could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige the Pope.

               <p>If I miſtake not, I have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſhewed the Weakneſs, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Nullity of what <hi>M.

<pb n="312" facs="tcp:97808:173"/>that the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi>

Nor do I doubt but that he knows, that <hi>Eugenius</hi> IV. himſelf, in the Bull which he made during the time of the ſixteenth Seſſion, approved all that the Council till then had done, and conſequently theſe Decrees of <hi>Conſtance</hi> renewed in the ſecond Seſſion, and the Synodal Anſwer wherein the ſame Council anew confirms thoſe Decrees, and backs them with very ſtrong Reaſons, which are there ſpecified at length.</p>
               <p>And now I have but two words to ſay to <hi>M. Schelſtrate</hi> concerning the Approbation of theſe Decrees. Firſt, if he be not ſatisfied with it, he muſt of neceſſity reckon as null all the Decrees which the firſt
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:97808:173"/>Councils made againſt the <hi>Arians, Macedonians,</hi> and the other Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, becauſe it is never to be found, that theſe Councils have been approved, neither ſo formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor ſo many times, as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of <hi>Conſtance</hi> have been, by the Popes <hi>Martin</hi> V. and <hi>Eugeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> IV.</p>
               <p>Again, that he ought to know, as I have formerly made it appear, that in the Ancient Church no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Approbation nor Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was ever known to have been made of Councils by the Popes, but the conſent which they themſelves, as well as others, were obliged to give to them. For, if after that the Councils of <hi>Nice</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> which were lawfully aſſembled in the Holy Ghoſt, had defined the Conſubſtantiality of the Word, and the Divinity of the Holy Ghoſt, the Popes <hi>Silveſter</hi> and <hi>Damaſus</hi> would not have received theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, nor have approved them: it is certain that they would have
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:97808:174"/>been reputed Hereticks by the whole Church; Who can doubt of that? And theſe Councils would have been no leſs infallible than they were in making their Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by the Inſpiration of that divine Spirit, which is the Soul of all Oecumenical Councils, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to theſe Words, <hi>Viſum eſt ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritui ſancto &amp; nobis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For to ſay that all the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Councils is derived from the Pope, who may not follow and approve their Deciſions concerning the Faith, and thereby take from them all their force, is an error condemned by the learned Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of <hi>Cambray, Peter D' Ailly,</hi> in moſt ſignificant terms, when preaching before the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and Pope <hi>Martin</hi> V. in the Year 1417. the ſecond Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day in <hi>Advent,</hi> about a month af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Election of that Pope, he related the whole Hiſtory of the Council which the Apoſtles cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed

                  <hi>that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of deciding and defining ought not to be attributed to the Pope alone, but to the whole General Council; whence it follows, that the moſt perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and dangerous Error to the Church, of ſome men, ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, who, to flatter the Pope, ſo rob the Council of its Authrity, that they have the Boldneſs to ſay, that the Pope is not of neceſſity obliged to follow the Deciſions of the Council; and that on the contrary, we ſhould teſt upon the Judgment of the Pope, if he oppoſe that of the Church, or of a General Council.</hi>

               <p>It is not ſo with the Pope, who is indeed Head of the Church Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, but not Maſter, Jeſus Chriſt having ſaid to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> as well as to all the other Apoſtles:<note place="margin">Matth. 20. Mark 12. Luke 22.</note>

                  <hi>Major eſt Authoritas orbis quam urbis.</hi> Thus the Pope as the chief part and Head of the univerſal Church, is above every part, and his power regulated according to the Canons extends over all the Churches taken particularly, and none are exempt from his Juriſdiction, but no ways over all the Churches aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in a General Council, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be for calling of them, and preſiding therein. And in this manner is to be underſtood what is to be found in the Bulls of <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> IV. and <hi>Leo</hi> X. in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of <hi>Florence</hi> and the <hi>Lateran,</hi> beſides that this laſt is not agreed upon to be an univerſal Council.</p>
               <pb n="322" facs="tcp:97808:178"/>
               <p>The other reaſon of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Baſil</hi> in its Synodal Anſwer is, that an Ecumenical Council hath received the gift of Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity as well as the univerſal Church, which it repreſents; and that the Pope may err, as I have proved it to have been the belief of all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity. But to avoid diſputing: This reaſon may be ſet off in a ſtronger and more convincing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by ſaying, They who hold an opinion contrary to that of the Superiority of a Council, are ſtill ready to grant that during a Schiſm it is above the Pope, who is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted, becauſe what is certain ought always to be preferred before the uncertain. This is a Principle then agreed upon on both ſides, from whence it may be thus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued.</p>
               <p>It is certain that a general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil repreſenting the Univerſal Church is Infallible; no Catholick can doubt of this. On the other hand it is not certain that the Pope is ſo, ſeeing many very able and
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:97808:178"/>Catholick Doctors, and moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Univerſities, not only doubt of it, but teach and vigorouſly maintain that he is not. Hence it muſt neceſſarily be concluded, that, ſeeing what is certain ought to be preferred before the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: The tribunal of a Council which, as it is certainly known, cannot err in its determinations, is over that of the Pope, who, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, may be deceived, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no certainty of his Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>It is evident that thoſe two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> when it was very lawful and approved by Pope <hi>Eugenius,</hi> make it appear that every General Council is above the Pope, both in the time of a Schiſm, and when there is no Schiſm; ſeeing in both times the Council is a <hi>whole,</hi> of which the Pope is but a part; and that it is certain that in both theſe times the Council is alike Infallible; and that at leaſt, it is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the Pope is, neither
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:97808:179"/>in the one nor other of theſe times.</p>
               <p>Having ſaid ſo much, I think I have fully anſwered <hi>M. Schelſtrate</hi> as to what he hath alledged in the diſſertation that he hath made againſt one of the chief Articles of the Declaration of the Clergy of <hi>France.</hi> For as to the long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe which that Author makes in one of his Chapters, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade us, upon the credit of his Manuſcript, that after great debates among the Nations it was at length reſolved, by common conſent, that the Reformation of the Church in the Head and Members ſhould not be attempted 'till after the election of the Pope: It is without doubt pitiful and deſerves not any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
               <p>Can it be concluded from thence that a Pope lawfully elected, who is preſent and preſides in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberations of a Council, is not a part of that <hi>whole</hi> and of that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which repreſents the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church, whoſe Authority ought
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:97808:179"/>to be preferred before that of any of its Members in particular, by that reaſon which proves that the <hi>whole</hi> is greater and more noble than any of its parts? And by what Philoſophy does he pretend to make us acknowledg, that from the preſence of a Pope in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, it follows that that Pope is not obliged to ſubmit to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees that may be made in it, even contrary to his own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when they are carried by the plurality of Voices, whether it be of individual Perſons or of Nations? That is the very thing in queſtion, to wit, if a Council whether the Pope be there or not, is above the Pope: How will he make out his proof?</p>
               <p>Beſides, it was not concluded in that Aſſembly of the Nations, that no Decrees concerning Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could be made before the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of a Pope, but only that before that time, they ſhould not all be made, and eſpecially ſuch as moderated the Power of the
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:97808:180"/>Pope, and confined it to juſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, it being very reaſonable that he ſhould be preſent at thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberations wherein he was ſo much concerned. The truth is, not to ſpeak of the other Decrees of Reformation that were already made in the Council, there was a very conſiderable one made rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Pope in the nine and thirtieth Seſſion, before the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of <hi>Martin</hi> V. who was not choſen till after the one and four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth.</p>
               <p>It is appointed by that Decree that the Popes being ſo much the more obliged to make the light of their Faith conſpicuous, by how much they are raiſed in Dignity above all others, ſhall for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture make in preſence of thoſe who have elected them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Election be Publiſhed, their Confeſſion of Faith accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Form preſcribed to them by the Council in the ſame Seſſion. That, without doubt was a pretty important Reformation,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:97808:180"/>ſeeing thereby was revived what heretofore had been practiſed, and what King <hi>Childebert</hi> demanded of Pope <hi>Pelagius</hi> I. to inform himſelf of his belief, becauſe it was thought that that Pope had too much favoured the <hi>Eutichyans,</hi> who had ſurpriſed him by their Artifices.</p>
               <p>The Council then might have made the other Decrees of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation before the Election of the Pope: but they were willing they ſhould not be made till after that the Pope was elected; and the manner how they appoint that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation to be made, is ſo far from favouring <hi>M. Schelſtrate,</hi> that it infers a concluſion quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to what he pretends, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly proves that the Pope, even when not queſtioned, is inferiour to a Council.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Statuit &amp; decernit.</note>And indeed the Council wills and ordains in the fourtieth Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Pope, either with the Council, or with the Deputies of the Nations, do reform the Church
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:97808:181"/>in the Head and Members, as to the Points that were to be given him, and that he make that Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation before the diſſolution of the Council. Was there ever a more authentick act of ſupreme Authority than this? When there was no more Schiſm, after the union of the three <hi>obediences,</hi> as <hi>M. Schelſtrate</hi> owns. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil ordains, that an undoubted Pope, ſuch as certainly he that was to be elected muſt be, do reform the Church in the Head and Members; but it will have it to be done with conſent of the Council. Any Biſhop may do as much: the difference is, that he ſhall not be Preſident of the Aſſembly, where he ſhall give his Vote as all the reſt do. Now if the Council will not in Body ſet about that work, it refers it to the care of the Pope in conjunction with the Deputies of the Nations. He doth not act then in that Reformation but by the authority of the Council that deputes him; and all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:97808:181"/>that he is to have over the reſt, is that he ſhall be the firſt Deputy at the Head of all the others.</p>
               <p>In fine, they preſcribe to him both the Articles upon which they would have the Decrees of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation made, and the time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they ſhould be expeded. If that be not to ordain, preſcribe, command, and conſequently if theſe be not evident marks, and Authentick acts of Authority and Superiority; I know none in the World. What will <hi>M. Schelſtrate</hi> then ſay now with his long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe about the five Nations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing that the Reformation ſhould not be made 'till after the Election of a Pope?</p>
               <p>But once more: What does he mean with the great myſtery he makes of this, that after much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate in the Aſſembly of theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, concerning the manner how the Decree ſhould be made, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by obliging the Pope with theſe Deputies to make the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:97808:182"/>formation before his Coronation,<note place="margin">Poſtea fuerunt factae diverſae formae decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti ad h. c: Tandem dictum fuit, quod Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa electus ligari non poterat.</note> or after, it was at length, ſaid <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa electus ligari non poterat,</hi> that <hi>when a Pope is choſen he cannot be bound?</hi> Does he by that then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that we are obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that a Pope lawfully elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as St. <hi>Silveſter</hi> was, is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to ſubſcribe to the Decrees of an Ecumenical Council, as that of <hi>Nice</hi> was: And that when ſuch a Council hath decided the conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiality of the word, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden Prieſts to marry, the Pope is not bound by theſe Decrees as well as the reſt of Chriſtians are, and that he is ſtill at liberty to believe of the one what he thinks fit, and to act in regard of the other as he pleaſes?</p>
               <p>But does he not ſee, that to have the true meaning of thoſe words they are to be applied to the Subject in queſtion: to wit, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ſhould be put into the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree that the Pope who was to be choſen,<note place="margin">Ante Coronationem Pape, &amp; Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem aliquam.</note> ſhould be obliged to make the Reformation before his Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:97808:182"/>nay and before he could have any part in the Government of the Church, and to give good ſecurity for it, as the <hi>German</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion demanded? Whereupon they had reaſon to ſay that a Pope could not be obliged to a thing ſo unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming the Pontifical Majeſty, nor ſo tied up as to deprive him of the Power he hath, by Divine Right, to Govern the Church, by virtue of his Primacy, from the very inſtant that he is Canonically elected Succeſſor of St. <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus ought theſe words to be underſtood in relation to what goes before, and not that the Pope is not obliged to any thing. The truth is, in the Decree that was made after that <hi>Conciliariter,</hi> in the fourtieth Seſſion, The Pope was not obliged in that manner, as the <hi>Germans</hi> had propoſed, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs he was bound in another moſt reaſonable manner, if I may ſay ſo, that is to ſay, he was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to reform the Church in the Head and Members, with conſent
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:97808:183"/>of the Council, or with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties of the Nations, before the end of the Council. But if <hi>M. Schelſtrate</hi> will ſtill be opinio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native and pretend that the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons underſtood ſomething elſe by theſe words, <hi>Quod Papa electus li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gari non poterat;</hi> there need no other anſwer to be made unto him, but that we muſt not ſtick to what hath been ſaid in the Aſſembly of the Nations, as he doth, but to what hath been defined <hi>Conciliari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> in the Seſſion, as we have juſt now mentioned.</p>
               <p>I am apt to believe now that <hi>M. Schelſtrate</hi> will be fully ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with me, ſeeing I have exactly anſwered Point for Point all that he hath ſaid upon his Manuſcripts unknown to the whole World for near three hundred years, and which at preſent, he thinks fit to object to us, as moſt Authentick Pieces, in the diſſertation he hath made againſt the Declaration of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, and againſt the perpetual Edict of the King,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:97808:183"/>who, as Protector of the Church, and of her Canons, makes it to be obſerved in all his Territories; and in fine, againſt the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> received by all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and eſpecially by <hi>France,</hi> which looks upon and reverences it, as its <hi>Palladium,</hi> the prop, ſupport and defender of its li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties.</p>
               <p>This being ſo, there remains no more but in a few words to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude what I have hitherto ſaid of the ſuperiority of a Council over the Pope. I made it out in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning that all Antiquity believed it, without the leaſt diſpute as to that Subject, as there happened about the time of the Council of <hi>Piſa.</hi> Then I clearly ſhew'd what that Council, and the two follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> even approved by the Popes <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> V. <hi>Martin</hi> V. and <hi>Eugenius</hi> IV. determined on that Subject in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of Councils. As to the times that have ſucceeded theſe three Councils, it is certain that
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:97808:184"/>all thoſe great Men, thoſe Biſhops, Cardinals, Popes, thoſe Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Learned Doctors of all Nations, who, as I have ſaid, have taught that Popes are not Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, have by conſequent maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that an Ecumenical Council, which cannot be doubted but to be Infallible, is above the Pope. But in a particular manner it is a Doctrin which the more renowned Doctors of <hi>Paris</hi> have always taught; I ſay, of that learned Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity the ancienteſt and moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous of all others; of whom if I ſhould make a Liſt, with the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of their Opinions, it would eaſily fill up a whole Book.</p>
               <p>It is enough for me to mention here what the great Cardinal of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> fearing that ſome term might be ſlipt in the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> that might be interpreted againſt that Doctrine of all <hi>France,</hi> cauſed his Secretary to repreſent to Pope <hi>Pius</hi> IV. in the year 1563. Theſe are the proper terms that he put into his inſtructions concerning
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:97808:184"/>that Point. <hi>I cannot deny but that I am a</hi> French <hi>Man, and have been bred in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of</hi> Paris, <hi>where it is held that the Pope is ſubject to a Council; and they who teach the contrary there, are looked upon and noted as Hereticks — The</hi> French <hi>will ſooner loſe their lives, than renounce that Doctrin — It would be folly to think that there is one Biſhop in</hi> France, <hi>that ever would conſent to the opinion contrary to that truth.</hi>
               </p>

Not that theſe words, <hi>regendi Eccleſiam uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſalem,</hi>
                  <pb n="336" facs="tcp:97808:185"/>ſignifie any thing elſe but that general Juriſdiction of the Pope, which reaches all the parts of the Church, in what concerns the Publick good of all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that he may ſee to it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Canons, as the Council of <hi>Florence</hi> expreſſes it, ſo as we have made it appear. But they would not have theſe words <hi>Eccleſiam univerſalem,</hi> ſo much as abuſed, to inſinuate thereby that the Pope is above the Church uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, taken altogether aſſembled and repreſented by an Ecumenical Council.</p>
               <p>And therefore, to remove all ambiguity, and to prevent the wreſting of theſe words to a ſenſe contrary to the Superiority of a Council, they ſaid, that inſtead of <hi>Regendi Eccleſiam univerſalem,</hi> it ought to be put into the Canon, <hi>Poteſtatem regendi omnes fideles, &amp; omnes Eccleſias;</hi> that <hi>the Pope hath the Power of Governing all Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and all Churches:</hi> which is to be underſtood of all, not Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled

So careful even to a ſcruple, have our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors been, to ſtand upon their guard on that ſide; that no attack in the leaſt might be made againſt the ancient Doctrin always invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably obſerved in this Kingdom. And it is moſt remarkable, that at that time when the Doctors of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> moſt ſtrenuouſly maintained that Doctrin, after the Councils of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil,</hi> againſt thoſe that ſtrove to invalidate their Decrees,<note place="margin">Innoc. <hi>VIII.</hi> Litter. ad Theol.

               <p>After all, that I may end where I began to handle this queſtion, I ſhall conclude with the teſtimony of another Pope, whom the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors who will have it, as <hi>M. Schel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate</hi> will, that Popes are above Councils, can never reject. And that is <hi>Pius</hi> II. who when he was no more but <hi>Aeneas Sylvius Picolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini,</hi> Clerk to the Council of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil,</hi> whereof he hath given us the Hiſtory, maintained with all his might, as well as the Doctors of <hi>Paris,</hi> that the Authority of a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council is Superior to that of a Pope. But when he himſelf was promoted to be Pope, he thought, for a reaſon that may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be gueſſed at, that he ought to make known to the World, that he had changed his Opinion, and that then he thought the quite contrary of what before he had maintained with all the heat that a Man ought to have who is well perſuaded of the Juſtice of the Cauſe whereof he undertakes the defence.</p>
               <pb n="339" facs="tcp:97808:186"/>
               <p>And that he ſolemnly did by a Bull, wherein he retracts; and in that Recantation, that he might declare that he followed another Opinion, he would not ſtiffle the manifeſt truth, concerning the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Opinion which he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook, and of the other that he embraced. For in this manner he ſpeaks in his Bull, hinting at the Conferences and Diſputes that were had with <hi>Juliano Ceſarini Cardinal of</hi> St. <hi>Angelo,</hi> who ſtood up for the intereſt of the Pope as much as he could, and yet for all that agreed in Judgment with the Council wherein he preſided.<note place="margin">Tuebamur antiqaam ſeutentiam, i le novam defendebat: Extolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bamus generalis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilii autoritatem, ille Apoſtolicae ſedis poteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem magnopere com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendabat.</note>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXVI.</hi> The ſtate of the queſtion, touching the Power that ſome Doctors have attributed to Popes over the Temporal.</head>
               <p>I Have, if I miſtake not, made it clearly appear in all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Chapters of this Treatiſe, how far the Ancient Church hath believed that the Power over Spirituals which Jeſus Chriſt gave to St. <hi>Peter</hi> and his Succeſſors, as Heads of the Univerſal Church extended. I am now to ſhew, whether, according to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of venerable Antiquity, they have alſo any Power over the Temporal of any perſon whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and eſpecially of Kings and other Sovereigns, by virtue of the primacy that by Divine right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to them.</p>
               <pb n="342" facs="tcp:97808:188"/>
               <p>Heretofore there have been ſome ſo paſſionately concerned for the Grandieur of the Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal See, or rather ſo blindly devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> that differs much from the Holy See, that they have dared to publiſh that the Pope repreſenting the perſon of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who is King of Kings, Lord of Lords, and Univerſal Monarch, who hath an abſolute Power over all Kingdoms, from which he may even depoſe Kings, if they fail in their duty, as theſe Kings may turn off their Officers who behave not themſelves as they ſhould. And this is called the direct Power which <hi>Boniface</hi> VIII. thought fit to take to himſelf in his <hi>Tuae unam Sanctam,</hi> that his Succeſſor <hi>Clement</hi> V. was obliged to recal.</p>
               <p>That is not the queſtion here: For I cannot think that now a days there is any Man who hath the boldneſs to maintain ſo palpable and odious a falſhood. But there are a great many beyond the <hi>Alps,</hi>
                  <pb n="343" facs="tcp:97808:188"/>who by the Philoſophical diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an indirect Power which they have invented, teach that the Pope may diſpoſe of Temporals, depoſe Kings, abſolve Subjects from their Oath of Allegiance that they have taken to them and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their Dominions to others, when he judges it to be neceſſary for the good of Religion, becauſe, ſay, they ſince he hath the inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction over every thing that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns it, ſo hath he Power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, deſtroy, and exterminate every thing that may annoy the ſame; and by that clinch they cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly enough come home to their Point though they would ſeem to forſake it. For a Pope will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways take the pretext of the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of Religion, when he has a mind to undo a Prince, as all theſe Popes have done who after <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. depoſed Emperors, and ſince them <hi>Julius</hi> II. who transferred the Kingdom of <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>Navarre</hi> to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> becauſe that King
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:97808:189"/>would not declare againſt <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is</hi> XII. whom this Pope perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</p>
               <p>Now ſeeing that Opinion which the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, and all our Doctors have always reckoned very dangerous and inconſiſtent with publick tranquillity, hath ſtill vouchers amongſt ſome Modern Doctors, eſpecially beyond the <hi>Alps:</hi> I muſt now make it appear, according to the method which I have followed in this Treatiſe, what the Doctrin of Antiquity is, as to that, and that the Ancients have always believed, that neither the Pope, nay nor the Church, have received any Power from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> but only over things meerly Spiritual, and wholly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from Temporals; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Kings and Sovereign Princes, according to the appointment of God, are not Subject, as to Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals, either directly or indirectly to any Eccleſiaſtical Power, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon God alone who hath eſtabliſhed them: And that they
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:97808:189"/>cannot be Depoſed, upon any Pretext whatſoever, by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church, nor their Subjects abſolved from the Oath of Allegiance and Obedience that they owe them.

<pb n="350" facs="tcp:97808:192"/>was not then <hi>propter iram,</hi> but <hi>propter conſcientiam,</hi> to ſatisfie their Conſcience, and obey the Law of God, that theſe Primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans inviolably kept their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance which they owed to their Emperors, though they were infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels and wicked.</p>
               <p>This is it which we have plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared to us in the Goſpel, and in the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul.</hi> Whereupon the true Divines, who in their Diſcourſes are not conducted by the bare light of Human Philoſophy, which many times degenerates into Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, but by the Principles of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that cannot deceive, have in all times made this truly Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Argument, to which no Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical ſubtlety can be objected.</p>
               <p>It is moſt evident by theſe clear and expreſs paſſages of Scripture, that Kings are ordained of God, and that the Allegiance and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience that Subjects owe to them, is of Divine Right.</p>
               <pb n="351" facs="tcp:97808:192"/>
               <p>Now neither Popes nor the Church can deſtroy and overthrow what God hath fixed, nor diſpence with that which is of Divine Right, as manifeſtly appears in what concerns the eſſential parts of the Sacraments, as for inſtance, of Marriage, of which it is ſaid, <hi>Quod Deus conjunxit, homo non ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paret.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore neither Popes nor Councils can ever depoſe Kings, nor acquit their Subjects from their Oath of Allegiance.</p>
               <p>And this is the more convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, that the contrary opinion has not ſo much as the leaſt appearance of any rational ground in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For of all the paſſages that are cited for maintaining it, there is not ſo much as one that is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by the Church in Councils, nor by any of the Holy Fathers, in that moſt erroneous ſenſe that they put upon them. Wherein theſe Modern Authors who in that manner do interpret them, act directly contrary to the Decree
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:97808:193"/>of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> fourth Seſſion, and againſt the Confeſſion of Faith enjoyned by <hi>Pius</hi> IV. which will have Scripture never to be interpreted but according to the ſenſe that Holy Church gives it, and according to the common Interpretation of the Fathers.

               <p>The ſecond paſſage is taken out of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> Chapter ſixteenth, where the Son of God ſaies to St. <hi>Peter, That whatever he ſhall bind upon Earth, ſhall be bound in Heaven, and whatever he ſhall looſe upon Earth ſhall be looſed in Heaven.</hi> Whence theſe new <hi>Rabbies</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the Succeſſors of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> have Power to diſſolve the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation that binds Subjects to their Prince, by the Oath they have made to him, and by the tie of Allegiance which binds them in fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to him.

               <p>But that we may not ſwerve from the words in queſtion, we need no more but read the Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Chapter of the ſame Goſpel of St. <hi>Matthew.</hi> There it is to be ſeen that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> repeats them to all his Diſciples, and gives them the whole Power that they import, by ſaying to them: <hi>Verily I ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, that whatever ye ſhall bind upon Earth ſhall be bound in Heaven, and whatever ye ſhall looſe upon Earth ſhall be looſed in Heaven.</hi> If theſe words comprehend the ſenſe that
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:97808:195"/>the new Authors give them, and that their meaning is alſo of the Temporal, it muſt needs be ſaid that all the Biſhops who are the Succeſſors of the Apoſtles, nay and all Prieſts who have the Power of binding and looſing, may depoſe Kings, and diſpence their Subjects from the Oath of Allegiance, which is the higheſt extravagance. Or elſe, let theſe Gentlemen tell us by what Authority of the Church or Holy Fathers they find that when they were ſaid to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> they have a different meaning from that which they ought to have when they were ſpoken to St. <hi>Peter</hi> and to all the Apoſtles.</p>

                  </note> openly declares that the Power of Prieſthood is confined to the ſole Right that God hath given to Popes to admoniſh, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, exhort, and to make uſe of their Spiritual Arms when it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, the care of Souls being joyned to their miniſtery, but not at all that of the Body, that is of the Temporal which God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for Kings. That is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction which God hath made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two Powers, the one wholly Spiritual, and the other Temporal, both which ought to keep within the bounds that the Maſter of both hath ſet to either of them.<note place="margin">Apud Athan.

               <p>I know that the Modern Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, having none of the Ancient Fathers of the Church for them, have thought at leaſt that they may make uſe of the teſtimony of a great Saint, who tho he be not of the number of thoſe who flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Ancient Church, and therefore are the true evidences of her belief, has nevertheleſs in a manner as great Authority, as is needful to make his Judgment paſs for a truth well confirmed. This Father is St. <hi>Bernard,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bernard. l. 4. de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider. c. 3.</note> who, upon theſe words of the Apoſtles to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; Here are two Swords,</hi> and upon the anſwer that he made to them, <hi>it is enough,</hi> ſaies, that theſe two Swords ſignifie the two Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,<note place="margin">Sed is quidem pro Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiá, ille ab Eccleſiâ exercendus eſt, ille Sacerdotis, is militis manu.</note> the Spiritual and the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral: that the material Sword ought to be employed for the Church,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:97808:198"/>and the Spiritual by the Church; this by the Hand of the Pope, and that by the Hand of the Soldier. Hitherto there is nothing at all that favours their Opinion. But what they found upon, are the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words, <hi>ſed ſane ad nutum ſacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotis &amp; juſſum imperatoris,</hi> that is to ſay, as they interpret it, <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the will of the Prieſt, and by the command of the Emperor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is an eaſie matter to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them, firſt that that is a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thought and an Alegory of St. <hi>Bernards</hi> invention. For of all the Holy Fathers who have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted the Goſpel unto us, there is not ſo much as one, that hath given to theſe words, <hi>Here are two Swords,</hi> that ſenſe, which is not at all literal, which we are not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to follow, nay and according to the Decree of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which we ought not to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low for fixing a Doctrin that we ought to embrace, ſeeing it is not conform to the common interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Holy Fathers.</p>
               <pb n="364" facs="tcp:97808:199"/>
               <p>Secondly, We'll tell them that the words of St. <hi>Bernard</hi> ought to be underſtood according to thoſe of <hi>Ceſarius Ciſtercienſis</hi> who flouriſhed in the ſame twelfth Age; and who, purſuing the ſame Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> ſaith, that the two Powers, the Spiritual and Temporal,<note place="margin">Unus gladius Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alis eſt qui Papae col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latus eſt à Domino; alter materialis, quem tenet Imperator, ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter à Deo collatus: hoc duplici gladio re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitur &amp; defenſatur Eccleſia Dei.</note> are the two Swords; that the Spiritual hath been given to the Pope, and the material to the Emperor, and that by theſe two Swords the Church is gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and defended: it is plain enough that by that the Spiritual Sword is only given to the Pope.</p>
               <p>In the third place,<note place="margin">Ceſar.

<pb n="365" facs="tcp:97808:199"/>the Pope:</hi> which is plainly to be ſeen by the oppoſition of theſe words, <hi>ad nutum Sacerdotis &amp; ad juſſum Imperatoris,</hi> which ſignifie two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent things, that the Soldiers take Arms by the command of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, <hi>ad Juſſum,</hi> and by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Pope <hi>ad nutum.</hi> It cannot be ſaid that that is by the command, otherwiſe St. <hi>Bernard</hi> would have ſaid briskly, <hi>ad Juſſum Sacerdotis &amp; Imperatoris;</hi> but he makes a diſtinction, and for the one ſaies <hi>ad Juſſum,</hi> and for the other <hi>ad nutum,</hi> by the counſel and advice.</p>
               <p>Juſt ſo as it is ſaid of the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in the Goſpel, <hi>Annuerunt ſociis qui erunt in alia navi; They beckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their companions that were in the other Ship:</hi> that <hi>annuerunt, beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned</hi> does not ſignifie a command, but an advice, an exhortation. They pray them to come: So that <hi>ad nutum</hi> which comes from the ſame verb <hi>annuere,</hi> means nothing more, but the advice, counſel and exhortation of the Pope, as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi>
                  <pb n="366" facs="tcp:97808:200"/>II. exhorted the Emperor and all Chriſtian Princes to croſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to take Arms againſt the <hi>Saraſins</hi> for reſcuing the Holy Sepulchre. And as we ſee at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts all the Potentates of <hi>Europe</hi> to League againſt the Turk, and ſends Money to the Emperor and King of <hi>Poland</hi> to carry on the War in <hi>Hungary</hi> againſt that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy of all Chriſtians. It will not be ſaid for all that, that the Pope commands theſe Princes to employ the material Sword: all that can be ſaid of it is, that the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Polanders</hi> make good uſe of their Swords in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and beat the Turks, <hi>ad nutam Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotis, &amp; ad Juſſum Imperatoris;</hi> by the counſel and exhortation of the Pope, and by the command of the Emperor and the King of <hi>Poland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to prove to theſe new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors that that is the true ſenſe of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> I'll only object to them the ſame <hi>Saint</hi> in the ſame
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:97808:200"/>Treatiſe of <hi>Conſideration</hi> to Pope <hi>Eugenius,</hi> wherein doubtleſs it will not be ſaid that he hath contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted himſelf, by overthrowing in one place what he hath built up in another. For in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he ſpeaks to the Pope, upon what our Saviour three or four times told his Apoſtles, that he would not have them to be like the Kings of the Gentiles, that bear Rule over their Subjects: <hi>It is plain,</hi> ſaith that Holy Man, <hi>that all Dominion is forbidden to the Apoſtles.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXIX.</hi> The Judgment of Ancient Popes touching the Power over Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals, that ſome Doctors of late times attribute to the Pope.</head>
               <p>THESE of all Men are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of greateſt Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and leaſt to be rejected, ſeeing the queſtion is about a Power that ſome would attribute to them, and which they openly declare they have not. I mean Ancient Popes, who for moſt part were great Saints, and who very well underſtanding their obligation, have always kept within the bounds of that Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Power which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning his Church according to the Laws and Canons of Ecumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Councils, ſo as the Council of <hi>Florence</hi> defined it.</p>
               <pb n="371" facs="tcp:97808:202"/>
               <p>The truth is, they were ſo far from attempting any thing upon the Temporal of Emperors and Kings, tho even Infidels and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, as to depoſing of them, and abſolving their Subjects from their Oath of Allegiance that they had taken to them, that they have always openly proteſted that they were wholly ſubmitted unto them, as moſt humble Subjects, and have acknowledged, as well as the great <hi>Oſius,</hi> that diſtribution which God hath made of the Temporal for So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns, and of the Spiritual for the Church, for the Popes and Biſhops.</p>
               <p>There is nothing more evident than this in Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory: We need only read the Epiſtle of Pope <hi>Gelaſus</hi> I. to the Emperor <hi>Anaſtaſius,</hi> wherein he makes that diſtinction of the two Powers, one Temporal, and the other wholly Spiritual, and both independent one of another: That of <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> I. to the Emperor <hi>Michael,</hi> wherein he diſtinguiſhes them, <hi>Actibus propriis &amp; dignitatibus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctis,</hi>
                  <pb n="372" facs="tcp:97808:203"/>by their Dignities and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Functions, which are of two quite different kinds; and what <hi>Gregory</hi> II. wrote to <hi>Leo Iſauricus,</hi> a moſt wicked Arch-heretick and cruel Perſecuter of Catholicks, ſaying to him in one of his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: <hi>In the ſame manner as the Pope has no Power of inſpecting the Palace of Emperors,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Quemadmodum Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifex introſpiciendi in Palatium poteftatem non habet, ac dignita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes regales conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di: ſic neque Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator in Eccleſias introſpiciendi, &amp;c. <hi>Gregor.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>nor of conferring Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Dignities, ſo neither hath the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror any right to meddle with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is enough, to ſhew that Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently made uſe of the example of that Pope againſt us, becauſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the relation of ſome Greek Hiſtorians, though the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins of that time take no notice of it, he by his Authority hindered the <hi>Romans</hi> his Subjects from pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Tribute which they owed him. To overthrow this weak Argument there needs no more, but to conſider <hi>Gregory</hi> in the quality of Pope, and then in the quality of the chief Citizen of <hi>Rome.</hi> As
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:97808:203"/>Pope he wrote to that <hi>Iconoclaſt</hi> Emperor long and excellent Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, wherein joyning force to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, he admoniſhes, reproves and exhorts him, he prays him, and threatens him with the Judgments of God; and then, ſo far was he from depoſing him from his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, that he prevents as much as in him lay, all <hi>Italy</hi> from revolting againſt him, and from acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another Emperor, thereby maintaining the People, who were ready to ſhake off the inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble yoak of ſo wicked a Prince, in their obedience.</p>
               <p>But when he ſaw that <hi>Leo</hi> grew more and more obdurate in his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety; that he had attempted two or three times to have him aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated; and that he gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the Forces of the Empire, to come and do at <hi>Rome,</hi> as he gave it out in all places, what he had done at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> in beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the Holy Images, and putting all to Fire and Sword, if they renounced not the Ancient
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:97808:204"/>Religion: Then, having as Pope, declared him Excommunicated, he did, as chief Citizen of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the reſt did, what the Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture allows, to wit, take the Arms out of a mad Man's Hand, and prevent the giving him money, which he would have uſed for their ruine and deſolation, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he put himſelf with the other <hi>Romans</hi> under the protection of <hi>Charles Martel,</hi> for the ſafety of their Religion and Lives, though for all that, this Pope never offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to depoſe <hi>Leo,</hi> nor to abſolve his Subjects from their Oath of Allegiance. For he himſelf and his Succeſſors long after acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperors for their Sovereigns, and it was not before the Empire of <hi>Conſtantin</hi> and <hi>Irene,</hi> that the <hi>Romans,</hi> and with them the Pope, as a Member of that Civil and Politick Body, and not by his Pontifical Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſeeing that they could no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er be defended againſt the <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards</hi> by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who had
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:97808:204"/>abandoned them, ſubmitted to <hi>Charlemagne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is fully and clearly made out in my Hiſtory of the <hi>Icono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claſts:</hi> Wherein it may be ſeen that the example of <hi>Gregory</hi> II. which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> alledges againſt us, is nothing at all to the purpoſe. As alſo more it may be ſeen there that Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> I. wrote to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantin Copronymus</hi> and to <hi>Leo</hi> his Son, both great Hereticks, in very ſubmiſſive terms, as to his Maſters and Sovereigns; and that's a thing which the Ancient Popes never failed to do.</p>
               <p>Let it be conſidered with what ſubmiſſion <hi>Pelagius</hi> I. wrote to <hi>Childebert</hi> King of <hi>France;</hi> who would have him ſend to him a Confeſſion of his Faith.

               </p>
               <p>Theſe holy Popes who were ſo afraid leſt the leaſt drop of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Blood ſhould be ſpilt, were far from depoſing Kings and Emperors, and giving away their Dominions to others, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of the good of Religion, as long after them ſome of their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors did; which was the cauſe of ſo many cruel Wars that with Blood and Butchery filled <hi>Italy, Germany,</hi> and <hi>France</hi> it ſelf during the League.</p>
               <p>In this manner the ancient Popes kept within the bounds of their Power purely Spiritual, rendering the honour and obedience which they owed to Temporal Powers, and eſpecially to their Sovereigns, nay even to their Sovereigns who were hereticks and Enemies of their Religion. This makes it very apparent, what learned Men have ſo clearly proved, that it is no more to be doubted of; to wit, that theſe Letters of St. <hi>Gregory</hi>
                  <pb n="379" facs="tcp:97808:206"/>are ſuppoſititious, wherein he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains that every King, Prelate, or Judg that ſhall neglect to preſerve the Privileges which that Pope gives to the Abbey of St. <hi>Medard</hi> of <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> and to three other Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of <hi>Autun</hi> be deprived of his Dignity, and as a deſtroyer of the Church, ſeparated from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Believers, and from the Body and Blood of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> that, in fine, he be ſmitten with all the <hi>Anathema's</hi> which till then had been thundered againſt all Hereticks, damned like <hi>Judas,</hi> and with him ſent headlong into Hell, if he do not do penance, and make his peace with the Monks.</p>
               <p>Such extravagant terms as theſe, and ſo remote from the temper and ſtile of St. <hi>Gregory</hi> are alone ſufficient to diſcover the groſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture, and the ſuppoſition of theſe pretended Bulls, which ſome have not been aſhamed to make uſe of, for ſubjecting the Crowns of Sovereigns to the Pope. That holy Pope behaved himſelf in a
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:97808:207"/>far different manner in relation to Kings and Emperors, as may be ſeen in all his Epiſtles.<note place="margin">Lego &amp; relego Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum regum &amp; Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat rum geſta, &amp; nuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam invenio quem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam eorum ante hunc à Romano Pontifice excommunicatum, vel Regno privatum. <hi>Otto.

               <pb n="381" facs="tcp:97808:207"/>
               <p>It was upon that ſo weak and ruinous a foundation, That this Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> undertook againſt the Ancient Doctrin of above a thouſand years, to ſettle that falſe and pernicious Opinion which he, the firſt of all Popes, put into practice, by Excommunicating and Depoſing the Emperor <hi>Henry</hi> IV. For as to what is ſaid to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary of Pope <hi>Zachary</hi> whom <hi>Bellarmine</hi> pretends to have taken the Crown from <hi>Childerick,</hi> and given it to <hi>Pepin,</hi> is of no force, and muſt needs proceed from a great ignorance of our Hiſtory.

               <p>For <hi>Theophanes</hi> a Greek Author of that time, tells us that Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> gave <hi>Pepin</hi> abſolution for the ſin which he had committed by violating the Oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance which he had taken to <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick.</hi> If that be ſo, it remains to enquire which of the two Popes was in the right: But it is not my part to examine that queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               </p>
               <p>As to what concerns <hi>Leo</hi> III. who is ſaid to have transferred the Empire of the Weſt to <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> it's a mere illuſion.

               <p>It is certain then, as <hi>Otho</hi> of <hi>Friſinguen</hi> aſſures us, that <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> VII. was the firſt Pope that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to depoſe Kings.

Now if in ſome of the Councils which ſucceeded the Pontificat of <hi>Gregory</hi> VII.

For, after all, there will be reaſon everlaſtingly to ſay, that which all Antiquity hath believed, that the Church her ſelf, infallible as ſhe is, which the Pope according to the ſame Antiquity is not, hath not

               <p>HItherto I have made appear what hath been the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Doctrin of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> of his Apoſtles, the Fathers, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Popes, and of the Councils, that is, of all venerable Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, concerning that Power, at leaſt
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:97808:211"/>indirect, which ſome would attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to Popes. Now ſeeing the moſt Chriſtian Kingdom, above all other States of Chriſtendom, hath always ſtuck cloſe to the Ancient Doctrin of the Church, which is the ſolid foundation of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties: Therefore it was that all the Biſhops of <hi>France</hi> repreſenting the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, the faculty of Theology of the great Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> ſo much reſpected in the World, the chief Parliament of <hi>France,</hi> and in imitation of it, the reſt, acting in the Name, and by the Authority of the King, as Protector of the Canons and holy Decrees, have even in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom maintained the Ancient Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, and upon all occaſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned that pernicious novelty which is contrary to it. This I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend briefly to prove.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, ſince the ſettlement of the moſt Chriſtian Monarchy amongſt the <hi>Gaules,</hi> hath always inviolably obſerved the Rights of the Royalty in her
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:97808:211"/>Councils, which were ſo often cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the ſole Authority of <hi>Clovis</hi> and his Succeſſors, eſpecially during the firſt and ſecond race of our Kings. And when the Popes would have attempted any thing upon their Temporal, the French Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops have always oppoſed it with all imaginable force and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour. Of this I ſhall give you ſome inſtances.</p>

But when it was diſcovered that inſtead of keeping within the bounds of a bare Mediator, for reconciling the Children to their Father, ſo as it was believed, he was come with a deſign to Excommunicate the Emperor and his Biſhops, if they obeyed not his Will and the Princes for whom he thereby manifeſtly declared himſelf againſt the Emperor: Then theſe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, without being ſtartled,<note place="margin">Nullo modo ſe velle vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntati ejas ſuccum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere: ſed ſi Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municaturus adveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, Excommunicatus abiret, cam aliter ſe babeas antiquorum Canonum autoritas.</note> made it known to him plainly, that in that they would no ways obey him, and that if he was come to Excommunicate them, he ſhould return Excommunicated
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:97808:212"/>himſelf, ſeeing the Authority of the ancient Canons preſcribes and ordains the quite contrary to what he attempts.</p>
               <p>The truth is that expreſſion ſeems to me a little too high: but it cannot be denied but that it makes it clearly out to us, that the Biſhops of <hi>France</hi> would not at all ſuffer that the Pope ſhould offer to enjoyn any thing concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Government of the State; and the Temporal intereſts which were the Points that occaſioned the War; and beſides that, they were very well perſuaded that Popes are Subject to the Holy Canons, and by conſequent to the Councils which have made them.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the great claſhing that <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Fair</hi> had with Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> VIII. who openly attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Rights of his Crown, is very well known; and it is alſo well known what the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church did for maintaining them,

Avis donné au Roy en ſon Conſeil par M. le Prince ſur le Cahier du Tiers Eſtat.</note> yet they avowed that they believed in ſubſtance the ſame thing which the third Eſtate had propoſed, and which the late Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> a great Defender of the Catholick Faith, moſt pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently repreſented to the King in Council the fourth of <hi>January</hi> the ſame year, and which the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of <hi>Paris</hi> expreſſed in moſt ſignificant terms in their Petition preſented to the Eſtates upon the ſame occaſion, the two and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of <hi>January:</hi> To wit,<note place="margin">Diſcours veritable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce qui s'eſt paſſé, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>That our Kings depend upon none but God us to Temporals, and that there is no Power upon Earth that
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:97808:215"/>can depoſe them, nor diſpence with, or abſolve their Subjects from the Obedience and Allegiance that they owe to them, under any pretext what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</hi> That was their Doctrin, which they would not have to be weakned or impaired in the Remonſtrances which they had cauſed Cardinal <hi>Du Perron</hi> to make to the Chamber of the third Eſtate.</p>
               <p>And certainly after ſo many proofs, one cannot doubt of the Opinion of that learned Clergy, always uniform as to that Point. I might here produce a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny very convincing Teſtimonies: but that would not be neceſſary now, after that famous declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Archbiſhops and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops aſſembled at <hi>Paris</hi> by order of the King in the year one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſix hundred and eighty two, as repreſenting the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, have made of their Judgment, concerning the Eccleſiaſtical Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. This is the firſt Article of it,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:97808:215"/>whereby they declare, <hi>That God hath given to St.</hi> Peter <hi>and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors the Vicars of Jeſus Chriſt, and to the Church Power over Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual matters, which belong to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation, but not over Civil and Temporal, The Lord having ſaid,</hi> My Kingdom is not of this World; and Render unto <hi>Ceſar</hi> the things that are <hi>Ceſars,</hi> and unto God the things that are Gods. <hi>And that Apoſtolical Decree ought to remain firm and inviolable,</hi> Let every Soul be ſubject unto the higher Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, for there is no Power but of God: The Powers that be are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God: whoſoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſiſteth the Power, reſiſteth the Ordinance of God. <hi>That Kings and Princes then, according to the Ordinance of God, are not ſubject to any Eccleſiaſtical Power, and that they cannot be depoſed, neither directly nor indirectly, by the Power and Authority of the Keys of the Church; that their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects cannot be exempted from the
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:97808:216"/>obligation that lies upon them to obey them, nor be abſolved from the Oath of Allegiance which they have taken to them; and that that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin ought inviolably to be obſerved as not only neceſſary for the publick Peace, but alſo uſeful to the Church; And as being conform to the word of God, the Tradition of the Fathers, and the examples of Saints.</hi> This now is a poſitive Doctrin that ſaith all; and all that I have written upon this Subject, hath only been to exhibit the convincing proofs of all the parts of that Article, which contains ſo excellent and ſolid a Declaration.</p>
               <p>As to the ſacred Faculty of Theology, it hath never failed on any occaſion to evidence its zeal for the true Doctrin, authoriſing and confirming this, by its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, and Cenſures of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion, from time to time renewed, eſpecially in the years 1413. 1561. 1595. 1610. 1611. 1620. 1726. And lately in the
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:97808:216"/>condemnation of an <hi>ultramonta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean Jacobin,</hi> by renewing the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Book of <hi>Santarelli.</hi> This appears ſtill in a ſtronger and more Authentick manner,<note place="margin">Non eſſe Doctrinam Facultatis, quod ſam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Pontifex aliquam in Temporalia Regis Chriſtianiſſimi anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatem habeat, imo Facultatem ſemper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiſſe etiam iis qui indirectam tantum modo illam Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem eſſe voluerunt.</note> by the ſix Propoſitions that were preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the King in the year one thouſand ſix hundred threeſcore and three, in name of the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; By my Lord <hi>De Prefixe</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> Viſitor of the <hi>Sorbonne.</hi>

               <p>Take here two of them which relate to that Article.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Eſſe Doctrinam Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultatem ejuſdem, quod Rex Chriſtianiſſimus, nullum omnino in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralibus habet ſupers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orem praeter Deum, eam<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> eſſe ſuam anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam Doctrinam, à quâ nunquam receſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra ſit.</note>The firſt, <hi>That it is not the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of the Faculty, that the Pope hath any Authority over the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral of the moſt Chriſhian King; that on the contrary it hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways oppoſed even thoſe who would have that Authority only indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other, <hi>That it is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of the ſame Faculty, that the moſt Chriſtian King hath no other Superior in Temporal affairs but God alone; and than that is the
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:97808:217"/>ancient Doctrin of the Faculty from which it will never ſwerve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After all, theſe Decrees of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church and of the ſacred Faculty have always been power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſupported by the Edicts of the Kings, and the thundring ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of Parliament, againſt all ſuch as ever durſt in <hi>France</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and teach that pernicious Doctrin condemned by theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions and Cenſures,<note place="margin">Of <hi>2</hi> Decemb. <hi>1561.4</hi> Januar. <hi>1594. 7</hi> &amp; <hi>10</hi> Jan. <hi>1595. 27</hi> May, &amp; <hi>26</hi> Nov. <hi>1610. 27</hi> July <hi>1614. 2</hi> Jan. <hi>1615.</hi> &amp;c.</note> which in this Kingdom are reverenced as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from God, upon whoſe word they are grounded. So that a Doctrin ſo well eſtabliſhed, and which all <hi>France</hi> look upon as the chief foundation of our Liberties, can never be ſhaken, much leſs overturned by Novelty, which, whatſoever effort it may make, ſhall never amongſt us prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Antiquity, to which we will always ſtick cloſe, as to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and ſolid Foundation of true Tradition.</p>
               <pb n="401" facs="tcp:97808:217"/>
               <p>And therefore alſo it is that the King, as Protector of the Canons of the Councils received in <hi>France,</hi> and of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church in particular, by his perpetual Edict regiſtred in all the Parliaments, not only prohibits all his Subjects, and all ſtrangers within his Kingdom, to teach or write any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Doctrin contained in the Declaration of the Clergy of <hi>France,</hi> but alſo commands all ſecular and regular Profeſſors to ſubmit to and teach it.</p>
               <p>Wherein it is moſt evident that his Majeſty does no more but what many Generals of Orders do, who, for preſerving the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of Doctrin in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation as to Points which they look upon to be of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for the good and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Body, oblige their inferiours to maintain and teach certain Opinions which the whole Order hath adopted againſt others who diſpute them. Much more
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:97808:218"/>ought it to be lawful for ſo great a King, ſo zealous for Religion, and for the Ancient Doctrin, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which are founded the invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable rights of one of the moſt Auguſt Crowns of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and liberties of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, to oblige his Subjects, for preſervation of Uniformity of Opinion within his Kingdom, as to Points of that importance, to maintain and teach the Doctrin of the Clergy of <hi>France,</hi> in all things conform to that of the Ancient Church.</p>
               <p>And ſo much I had to ſay in this Treatiſe, wherein, always fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing that Principle which both Catholicks and Proteſtants equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agree to, I have held a mean betwixt the two extremes that ought to be ſhunned. One is of thoſe, who, blinded by the hatred which they have conceived againſt the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from which they have ſeparated, would take from the Pope the Prerogatives
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:97808:218"/>which Antiquity hath believed were given him by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as Succeſſor of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> The other of thoſe, who through a zeal not according to knowledg, nay, and if I dare ſay with thoſe Cardinals of <hi>Paul</hi> III. through a too great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with Popes, attribute to them, what Antiquity inſtructing us by the Fathers, the Councils, and even by the moſt Ancient and moſt holy Popes themſelves, have believed they never have received from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seeing the mean is the place of Virtue and Truth: I think one cannot miſtake the way when he follows Antiquity for his guide, which placing us with it ſelf in that lovely mean, will make us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn our Proteſtants who are in the firſt extreme, and abandon thoſe who abandon themſelves to novelty, under the conduct where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are fallen into the other extremity.</p>
               <pb n="404" facs="tcp:97808:219"/>
               <p>Now if it be ſaid to me that theſe new Authors, who have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into that which I call the ſecond extreme, have only done ſo out of the great zeal which they have for Religion: It will be eaſie for me to anſwer with the great Pope St. <hi>Leo, That many times Men carry on their private intereſts under a ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of Piety,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Privatae cauſae pieta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis aguntur obtentu, &amp; c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>and that every one maketh Religion to be the handmaid of his luſts and deſires.</hi> The truth is, it may very well be, that the luſtre of the Purple, wherewith at <hi>Rome</hi> the three Authors who have moſt highly exalted the Power of Popes, by raiſing it beyond all the bounds that Antiquity preſcribed to it, were cloathed, may have daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Eyes of that croud of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern who have followed them, and who for all that, what ever they may have expected, never received a like reward.</p>
               <p>But not to Judge of the ſecret motives of their Heart, which it belongs to God alone to dive into,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:97808:219"/>I had rather Anſwer with <hi>Vincen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Lirinenſis,</hi> one of the moſt zealous Defenders of the true Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin: <hi>Mos iſte ſemper in Eccleſiâ viguit, ut quo quiſque religioſior foret,</hi>

                  <hi>eo promptius novellis adventionibus contrairet. It hath always been the cuſtom in the Church, that the more of Piety and Religion any one had, the more ready he was to oppoſe all new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions in Doctrin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to conclude my Work with the excellent words of the ſame Author, I ſhould be glad that Men would think that in compoſing it I have had no other deſign but to diſcharge the duty of a good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, by doing what he enjoyns me, when he ſays:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſtianus Catholicus providebit ut Antiquitati inhaereat, quae prorſus non poteſt ab ulla Novitatis fraude ſeduci.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Catholick Chriſtian will have great care to ſtick cloſe to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, which cannot be deceived by the artifice of Novelty.</p>
